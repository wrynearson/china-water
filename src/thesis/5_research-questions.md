# Research Questions 

From [thesis_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/wrynearson/china-water/blob/master/src/thesis/thesis_analysis.ipynb)

Several questions are examined:

- R1. How do peoples perception of water quality (importance, status, severity, their knowledge, etc) align with actual water quality?
    - R1.1. Is there a correlation between water quality and perception of water quality? (I.e. do perceptions and reality match)?
- R2. Does knowledge of water quality affect perception?
- R3. Does the level of obtained education relate to water quality knowledge?
- R4. Does the level of obtained education relate perception?
- R5. Are there differences between water quality perception, and water quality knowledge, in rural vs. urban households?

Hypothesis:
* More education positively relates to increased perception of severity of water quality issues (`l14d`→ 1)
    * I.e. A higher level of education relates to a more severe sense that water pollution negatively affects the environment.
* A higher level of education relates to more knowledge about water quality
* Worse local (provincial) water quality relates to an increased perception of severity of water quality issues (`l14d`→ 1)
* Rural households have a more severe perception of water quality issues than urban households

| Research Question: | H0 (Null Hypothesis)                                                       | H1 (Hypothesis)                                                                                                            |
|:------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R1                 | Worse local water quality is independent of water quality perception.      | Worse local (provincial) water quality relates to an increased perception of severity of water quality issues (`l14d`→ 1). |
| R2                 | Increased knowledge is independent of perception.                          | An increase knowledge of water quality issues relates to an increased perception of severity.                              |
| R3                 | Increased education is independent of knowledge of water quality.          | Increased education relates to more knowledge about water quality.                                                         |
| R4                 | Increased education is independent of an increased perception of severity. | Increased education relates to an increased perception of severity                                                         |
| R5                 | There is no significant difference between urban and rural households.     | There is a significant difference in perception of severity of water quality issues between urban and rural households.    |
