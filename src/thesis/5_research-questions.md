# Research Questions 

From [thesis_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/wrynearson/china-water/blob/master/src/thesis/thesis_analysis.ipynb)

Several questions are examined:

* How do peoples perception of water quality (importance, status, severity, their knowledge, etc) align with actual water quality?
* Is there a correlation between water quality and perception of water quality? (I.e. do perceptions and reality match)?
* Does knowledge of water quality affect perception?
* Does general education affect perception?
