# Background

## Environmental Policy, Education and Perception

Water quality and quantity issues in China and abroad sit within the context of environmental policy, environmental education, and societies' perception of the two. [@caldwell1990international]

### Environmental Policy

Environmental conservation has a long and global history, at times being documented as early as the seventh century, with examples afterwards often being local or anecdotal. [@StCuthbertFather2013] In the broader context of environmental appreciation or dependency, the history likely goes back to the dawn of humanity. This is evident in written and modern-day history as some indigenous cultures do not separate the environment and the society. [@armieroHistoryEnvironmentalismLocal2014, p. 2-3]

Much of the documented history of modern environmentalism and environmental policy comes from the United States. Water pollution was one of the first environmental issues which received federal legislation with the The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 [@ModernEnvironmentalMovement], which later became known as the Clean Water Act. [@usepaHistoryCleanWater2013]

Despite much of the literature covering history in the United States, environmental protection can be seen as a global phenomenon in many parts of the world and throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, albeit with differing impact, scope and timeliness. The link to its global nature is highlighted in a study which finds that international organizations and communities have central importance in the diffusion of one particular type of environmental policy, the Environmental Impact Assessment, and its particular importance for less-developed countries. [@hironakaGlobalizationEnvironmentalProtection2002]

### Environmental Education

Environmental Education (EE) has been inexorably tied to environmental protection and policy - one of its main goals is "Awareness - to help social groups and individuals acquire an awareness and sensitivity to the total environment and its allied problems." [@IntergovernmentalConferenceEnvironmental] An earlier definition was presented in 1969 from the United States, and has proved reliable and accurate since:

> **Environmental education** is aimed at producing a citizenry that is **knowledgeable** concerning the biophysical environment and its associated problems, aware of **how** to help solve these problems, and **motivated** to work towards their solution. [@stapp1969concept]

Progress continued with development and deployment of EE the international level, with many landmark events in environmentalism and sustainability putting EE at their core, including The International Environmental Education Program (IEEP 1975), the World Conservation Strategy (IUCN 1980), 'Tbilisi Plus Ten' (1987), Our Common Future (WCED 1987), and The Earth Summit (UNCED). [@nealHandbookEnvironmentalEducation2003, p13-15]

EE also has the potential for direct and indirect positive environmental impacts. One study reviewed 105 EE studies which emphasized conservation outcomes, and found that EE programs which included and focused on ecological indicators (such as improved water quality) had outcomes with the most directness (as opposed to indirect impact categories such as community capacity building), and concluded that local aspects of regional and global problems are important for the directness of the link. [@ardoinEnvironmentalEducationOutcomes2020]

While there is a longer document environmental protection movement in the United States than in China, it is important to note that Dr. Stapp wrote this definition with the perspective that only 50 years had passed since much of the nation was rural and underdeveloped. It can be argued that China shares this temporal perspective today.

### Environmental Society (Perception)

### In China

Despite its international perception (often correct) of poor environmental protection, China does have a long history of environmental policy, with "great leaps" of progress and reform every decade or so since the political reform in the early 1970s. [@xieChinaHistoricalEvolution2020] #check-source There is also evidence showing that environmental issues and their repercussions are deemed important by the local population. One study found that Chinese university student were more concerned about environmental risk, and deemed "environmental issues to be more harmful to health, to the environment, and to social economic development of the nation than did the American respondents.environmental issues to be more harmful to health, to the environment, and to social economic development of the nation than did the American respondents." [@duanCrossCulturalStudyEnvironmental2012] Furthermore, they found that Chinese students were concerned about fresh water shortage, and safe drinking water shortage more than other environmental concerns, and only less so than human population growth.

## Water Quality and Perception

### Factors in Water Quality 

**Talk about components of water quality, aesthetics, harmful vs. non-harmful components, local and global rankings, drinking vs using, etc.**

China often cites its developing country status as a reason that it under-performs on environmental indicators. #cite However, China ranks lower than other countries with similar or even lower GDP. [@wendlingz.a.2020EnvironmentalPerformance2020, p. X, fig. ES-1] Overall, China ranked 120th with a score of 37.3 in 2020, which was the same ranking as in 2018 but with a decreased score from 50.74.[^1] [@wendlingz.a.2020EnvironmentalPerformance2020 p. XII; @wendling2018EnvironmentalPerformance2018 p.15] 

In 2020, China ranked 54th (6th regionally) in sanitation and drinking water, with a score of 59.4/100. [@wendlingz.a.2020EnvironmentalPerformance2020, p. 57] Specific rankings for sanitation and drinking water were not available for 2018. For the broader category of Environmental Health (HLT), China scored 31.72/100. [@huangEnvironmentalPerformanceAsia2019]

Access to water is another factor in the population's perception of water.

China has increased its use of basic sanitation services by 28% from 2000-2017 [@jmpworld2019progress, p. 31, fig. 33] and achieved 100% safely managed drinking water access. [@jmpworld2019progress, p. 48, fig. 51] #check-source

China's improvement in water infrastructure has gone on for decades, with particular improvement since 1990 with an increases in municipal water supply utilities coverage from 50% in 1990 to 88% in 2005. [@browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007, xvii] In the same report on infrastructural improvements, the authors repeatedly cite concerns for water quality and quantity issues, citing the problem originating from "outdated water treatment technology and high levels of pollution in the raw water." [@browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007, p. 17] The report also states that "Water quality monitoring is generally poor and the data is consequently unreliable," however this is outdated. [@browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007, 17] The report continues that national policies, including drinking water quality, are only implemented in higher-tier cities and are often loosely enforced. [@browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007, p. 30] The problem was especially evident in second tier, third tier and non-urban towns, as evident below:

[@browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007, p. 31, tab. 3.1]

The report continues, noting a slight increase in average category V or V+ in Chinese rivers from 1991 - 2002. [@browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007, p. 33, fig. 3.3] It also notes discrepancies between water supply, water quality and public information for residents to judge the quality themselves (i.e. perception), noting that most urban residents do not drink water directly and is first boiled, which is both a cultural tradition and response to "the uncertain quality of the water from the tap." [@browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007, p. 61]



### Water Quality Perception

While actual water quality is clearly important, so too is perception. Many factors exist in the public's perception of water quality. While "organoleptic properties" exist, most notably flavor, others exist including "risk perception, attitudes towards water chemicals, contextual cues provided by the supply system, familiarity with specific water properties, trust in suppliers, past problems attributed to water quality and information provided by the mass media and interpersonal sources." [@migueldefrancadoriaFactorsInfluencingPublic2010] Water quality perceptions are especially important when water is used for drinking or other domestic purposes, causing some to consider perceptions of water quality more important than actual water quality. [@sheat1992public] Thus, it is important for policy makers to consider not only reality of water quality, but also the public's perception. Trends indicate that water quality policy should include not only the protection of human health, but also "acceptability." [@BonnCharterSafe2004 §7.7]

Research into water quality perception has existed since the 1960s, but is very heterogeneous, including; different use cases of water (drinking, household, agricultural, etc.); different delivery methods (piped, bottled) and different geographic and demographic localities, with most research conducted on bottled water and in developed countries. [@migueldefrancadoriaFactorsInfluencingPublic2010]

One study represented research in an under-studied theme and demographic. Stakeholders' perceptions of important measures of river water quality in one region of Ghana suggest that in developing countries (or regions with lower objective water quality), faecal matter in and around rivers, and presence of plastic waste in rivers was deemed to be the most important measure, followed by the smell, clarity, color, and taste ("organoleptic properties") of the water. [@okumahWhatMattersMost2020, fig. 3]


### Linking the Two
While many studies have examined the issues discussed earlier, few have looked at the alignment of water quality perceptions and actual water quality. One such study was conducted in Newfoundland, Canada, which "investigated public perceptions of water quality and the perceived health risks and associated with the actual quality of public water supplies in the same communities." [@ochooAssociationPerceptionsPublic2017] While they found "no association with public satisfaction level and actual water quality of the respective communities," they did show demographic disparities in water quality perception.[^2] Furthermore, the authors found that differences in opinion existed between respondents who were supplied by the same water system. However, this is expected due to the problematic nature of public opinion. [@shepardPublicOpinion1909] The authors also mentioned that water quality data is publicly available, but is most likely not communicated in a way which facilitated knowledge transfer.

###### Notes

China's political situation does not negate the impact that society can have on environmental policy. One study found that Chinese civil society organizations (CSOs) work in similar ways to those in more liberal and democratic countries. [@teetsPowerPolicyNetworks2018]

Multiple factors drive environmental perception. One study found that "age, percentage of time spent on farming and social network are the main determinants of awareness" and perception of water scarcity in the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi Province, China. [@tangEstimationAwarenessPerception2013]

[^1]: The framework of the overall EPI score is comprehensive and weighs 32 indicators. However, the weighting of some indicators changed between 2018 and 2020, making comparison difficult. The visualization of each years breakdown can be seen in 2018 [@wendling2018EnvironmentalPerformance2018, p. 6, fig. 2.1] and 2020 [@wendlingz.a.2020EnvironmentalPerformance2020, p. XI, fig. ES-2].

[^2]:  The authors concluded that "Older, higher educated and high-income group respondents were more satisfied with water quality than the younger, less educated and low-income group respondents." However, they also stated that "We had little scope to explore the possible explanations, and hence further studies are required to verify the age, gender educational status and income differential about the satisfaction of public service like water supply."
