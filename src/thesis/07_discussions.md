# Discussion

The discourse on water quality should have a more holistic focus which values local knowledge, subjective perspectives and increased awareness to complement the primary focus on direct water quality. China has made a range of commitments, and notable action, on improving the country's water quality. This is in line with Sustainable Development Goals 6 â€“ Clean Water and Sanitation. However, China still has substantial improvements to make: for example, water stress is high and expected to increase (SDG 6.4.2), and household wastewater treatment is low (SDG 6.3.1 - 38%). [@CountryAreaSDG] SDG 6.3 focuses on water quality:

> By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally. [@martinWaterSanitation] #check-source

State-lead infrastructure programs are not enough to meet many of the SDG 6 targets and indicators #cite. Inclusion of local knowledge and expertise can aid in this effort. The less-discussed SDG 6.B mentions this:

> Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management. [@martinWaterSanitation] #check-source

While data is limited, China had low participation from users and communities for drinking water, sanitation and hygiene promotion in both rural and urban areas, and only had moderate participation for national water resources planning and management in 2017. [@CountryAreaSDG] This seems to have improved with urban and rural drinking water, with high and moderate levels of participation in 2019, respectively.
