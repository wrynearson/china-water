<h3>Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS)<a class="headerlink" href="#chinese-general-social-survey-cgss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This national survey, originally launched in 2003, aims to monitor and document relationships between quality of life (in both individual and collective scope) and social structures, both in urban and rural environments. [&#64;HomeZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha] One of the main benefits is its longitudinal design – however this feature is not utilized in this thesis, which will be discussed later. The survey has been conducted nearly annually since 2003, with a major redesign conducted in 2010. Thus, surveys conducted prior to 2010 are referred to as “Cycle II” while surveys conducted in 2010 or later are referred to as “Cycle II.”</p>
<p>The CGSS is conducted by face-to-face interviews, which on average require 90 minutes to complete. [&#64;ImplementationZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha] The survey consists of a questionnaire, which is composed of three modules (beginning in Cycle II):</p>

<p>[&#64;QuestionnairesZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha]</p>
<p>The published data is in the form of a Stata file, which consists of 11783 rows (respondents) and 871 columns (variables).</p>
<p>The Environmental Module (“环境(ISSP)” or “L部分”<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id10" id="id1">6</a>) is of particular interest in this analysis. [&#64;DiaoChaWenJuanZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha] It asks 25 questions and sub-questions, most of which are directly or indirectly related to the environment. There are several interesting questions which ask things related to environmental protection, importance, perception and knowledge:</p>
<p>The primary question regarding water quality perception was question <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l14d</span></code> ask about the severity of harm to the environment caused by pollution of rivers and lakes.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id10" id="id2">6</a>. Survey participants can respond with a range from one to five, with one being “extremely harmful to the environment,” to five being “there is no harm at all.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id11" id="id3">7</a> This question is significant because it quantifies the respondents’ perception of the severity of water quality on the environment. However, this question does not directly regard the perception of drinking water quality, or the importance of drinking water quality for health or other factors.</p>
<p>The primary question regarding water quality knowledge was question <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l2409</span></code> tests respondents’ knowledge of the water quality scale used by China. The question requires respondents to state if a statement about water quality is correct, incorrect, or if they don’t know. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id12" id="id4">8</a> This question is important since it tests respondents’ knowledge of the water quality scoring system used in China. However, this question does not directly test users knowledge of the underlying environmental and pollutant issues which are the basis of this water quality scale, nor does it test their knowledge or education about environmental issues or protection directly.</p>
<p>Many other interesting questions are present in the data set. For this thesis, several others were selected, and the values were analyzed. This discussion is presented later in this thesis.</p>

<div class="section" id="blue-city-water-quality-index-ranking-wqir">
<h3>Blue City Water Quality Index Ranking (WQIR)<a class="headerlink" href="#blue-city-water-quality-index-ranking-wqir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second data set was compiled by the author from a report from the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs, a non-profit environmental research organization based in Beijing. [&#64;IPE] The report, the <em>Blue City Water Quality Index 2019</em>, compiles various surface, drinking, and ground water quality data published by various government agencies and assigns a score (their proprietary <em>Blue City Water Quality Index Score (BCWQI)</em>) and publishes the results at a sub-provincial level (second administrative level, or “admin 2”). [&#64;jun2018BlueCity] The methodology and conversion to the government’s water quality score is provided. This report was chosen as the basis for this data set since it was the most comprehensive data the author could find with the closest publication date to the CGSS. The difference in time of the two data sets is discussed in the #limitations section. In the appendix of this report, the BCWQI for each second administrative level, including the city name, province, and ranking, is included. This data, in a table in the PDF report, was exported into a comma separated value (.csv) file for later analysis.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the water quality score used in the WQIR data set is derived from the official Chinese water quality scoring system. The following table translates between the two scoring systems: [&#64;jun2018BlueCity, p.5]</p>

<h2>Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Analysis for this thesis was conducted using the general-purpose computer programming language Python. To allow for accessibility, readability, and reproducibility, the primary data analysis medium was a Jupyter notebook [&#64;kluyverJupyterNotebooksPublishing], a document format which allows for text and code to be read and execute in an easy-to-read format, which was hosted on GitHub, to allow for accessibility. [&#64;rynearsonWrynearsonChinawater2020] This was chosen after initial data analysis was conducted in a more traditional Python file, which was less collaborative and more cumbersome.</p>
<p>The two main data sets were loaded into the Jupyter notebook and reviewed for initial analysis, beginning with the CGSS2010. Then, after reviewing the data, it was cleaned and processed in several ways:</p>

<p>The thesis proposal and hypothesis were created before the author reviewed the data set, and before the author was aware of the environmental module of the CGSS.

<p>As evident, these questions include questions related to the environment in general, perceptions of the local, national and global environment, water, and knowledge of water quality issues.</p>
<p>Many more survey questions were included in the main and additional module sections. Many of these relate to social satisfaction, political involvement, and future aspirations. Future analysis could be done with many of these questions, but were not within the scope of this analysis.</p>

<h3>Geographic Alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#geographic-alignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The two data sets are of differing geographic precision. The CGSS2010 (and all CGSSII data sets) include data on the province of where the respondent resided. Based on the structure of the data, it is assumed that more precise geographic information is included, however the CGSS publishing team chooses only to release the provincial information.</p>
<p>This is different than the WQIR2018 data, which is published at the sub-provincial level (admin 2). Thus, for comparative analysis, the mean water quality per province was calculated (more on this below).</p>
<p><strong>Insert Admin1 and Admin 2 maps here.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="procedure">
<h3>Procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#procedure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once the data sets were loaded and reviewed for importance and quality, initial data analysis was conducted. Due to the author’s limited experience with Python, multiple versions of the analysis were conducted in order to gain working knowledge of Python and of the data set.</p>
<p>For provincial comparative analysis, the data was sorted by province <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s41</span></code> and grouped into visual and numerical approaches of looking for differences between provinces. Several functions were created which allowed the author, and users, to see provincial comparative analyses on any question by inputting the question code. Either quantities of responses or their mean value would be output, as well as a heatmap for quick comparison. This initial analysis helped the author validate the main variables that were analyzed, which are discussed later.</p>
<p>Then, the WQIR2018 data was loaded. An initial plot was created to see the distribution of water quality per sub-province, sorted by province. Histograms were added to visualize the distribution of water quality measurements and values.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="wqir2018-vis">
<img alt="_images/wqir2018.svg" src="_images/wqir2018.svg" /><p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 1 </span><span class="caption-text">WQIR2018 distribution per province.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#wqir2018-vis" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p><img alt="wqir2018.svg" src="_images/wqir2018.svg" /></p>
<p>From the previous steps, a subset of questions were created. Two main questions and one demographic variable were identified for further analysis: question <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l14d</span></code> was used as the the main question to quantify perception<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id10" id="id7">6</a>; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l2409</span></code> was used as the main question to quantify water quality knowledge<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id12" id="id8">8</a>; and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a7a</span></code> was used to quantify education.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id14" id="id9">10</a> These questions are discussed more in depth in the following limitations section. Other demographic data was used to control for results of the analysis. Many other relevant and interesting questions could be investigated from the data, but they are outside of the scope of this thesis.</p>
<p>Next, the values of these were examined. The author spent significant effort on this stage to better understand the state of the data set, and to understand the implications of choices in cleaning this data. Several revealed to be outside of the acceptable range, such as being recorded as negative numbers not present in the valid response list. Since the origin or reason behind these values could not be determined, they were discarded. This lead to further discrepancies in the number of values per category, including per province, education, perception and knowledge. This is discussed further in the analysis section.</p>
<p>Once invalid values were removed, the two data sets were merged on their shared province values. This was done in two separate ways, which allowed for different analysis.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><strong>On Provinces</strong>:  The mean water quality per province was added to the mean value per province of each analyzed variable. This allows for simpler data analysis, but loses some individual demographic data (gender, income, age, education, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On Individuals</strong>: The mean water quality per province was added to the individual response values. This makes the analysis slightly more complicated, but allows for comparison across the demographic data mentioned above. However, it should be noted that it runs the risk of providing a false sense of improved precision, and the mean water quality of the province may not accurately reflect the local situation of the individual.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While the author spent substantial time on analysis using the first method, the results of this study are mostly presented using the second method as they are more robust. The author conducted a large correlation test examining the correlation between every combination of questions and demographic data. While this test provided interesting results and provided inspiration for further investigation, most of the findings were outside of the scope of this thesis.</p>
<p>Once the data was analyzed, the author aligned the research questions and hypothesis with the data set variables. Each research question, and each tested hypothesis, was examined for correlations between two relevant variables, and were compared against one or more variables as a control. The analysis and findings are mentioned in the analysis section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Several limitations exist based on the scope of both data sets, as well as limitation with some of the assumptions made by the author.</p>
<p>First, as discussed previously, there is misalignment between the CGSS and the WQIR data sets on two dimensions. The first is geographic. Since water quality data offered more geographic precision than the social survey responses (i.e. smaller regions), the effectiveness of comparison is reduced. This is in addition to the fact that water quality scores were originally presented as mean values per prefectural regions. This is different than the CGSS responses – while they were recorded at a more local level, geographic alignment information is only available at the provincial level. Further, the comparison between individuals and mean values per prefectural region results in the possibility that an two individuals in the same prefectural region experience different water quality, which is not possible to account for in the current methodology.</p>
<p>The second misaligned dimension is temporal, as the CGSS responses and water quality data differ by seven years. This is not ideal, since multiple indicators could have changed between that time. One is water quality, which has changed due to factors including the national government’s initiatives, but this change has not been uniform across the country. Another indicator which could have changed is knowledge about water quality issues. Third, perception of water quality could have changed as well.</p>
<p>Further limitations come from the perceived findings based upon the CGSS question set. The two main questions which were analyzed, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l14d</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l2409</span></code>, are not perfectly analogous to the conclusions the author made. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l14d</span></code> refers more to rivers and lakes in China, which are not necessarily the drinking water sources which are used by the respondent. Further, the severity of pollution being harmful to the environment is not necessarily the same as the respondents’ perception. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l2409</span></code> directly tests respondents’ knowledge of water quality scales used by China, but this question, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l14d</span></code>, do not necessarily test for knowledge, and perception, of the local water quality - the question refers to China in general.</p>
