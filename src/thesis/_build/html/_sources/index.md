Poor water quality and its grave implications for health, economic and political security are especially acute in China. This thesis adds the human experience component by examining how water quality, water quality knowledge and water quality perception are related. Demographic and questionnaire responses from the China General Social Survey ($n=11783$) were aligned with water quality scores ($n=363$) from the Blue City Water Quality Index Report. The data shows that there is broad concern for environmental issues individually and nationally, and that water quality concerns rank highly on individualsâ€™ list of environmental issues. The analysis indicates that perceived severity of poor water quality increases as water quality worsens. Water quality knowledge also improves with increased education and with worse water quality. The results suggest that China should complement infrastructure-based water resource management solutions with diverse, local, and inclusive policy and education in order to meet its ambitious water resource management targets.
