  {"id":"ardoinEnvironmentalEducationOutcomes2020","abstract":"Effective environmental education represents more than a unidirectional transfer of information: rather, this suite of tools develops and enhances environmental attitudes, values, and knowledge, as well as builds skills that prepare individuals and communities to collaboratively undertake positive environmental action. Environmental education also facilitates connections between actionable research findings and on-the-ground practices, creating synergistic spaces where stakeholders collaborate to address dynamic environmental issues over time. Because of this commitment to application and iteration, environmental education can result in direct benefits to the environment and address conservation issues concretely. Yet, the path to achieving those tangible impacts can be winding, with robust data documenting changes challenging to produce. To better understand the research-implementation spaces where those environmental education outcomes occur, are measured, and are reported, we undertook a systematic review of research on environmental education's contributions to conservation and environmental quality outcomes. Given the variation in research designs and data, we used a mixed-methods approach to the review; analysis of the 105 resulting studies documented strongly positive environmental education outcomes overall and highlighted productive research-implementation spaces. Chi-square analyses revealed that programs reporting direct outcomes, compared with those reporting indirect outcomes, differed on primary topic addressed. A narrative analysis indicated that environmental education programs documenting direct impacts included: a focus on localized issues or locally relevant dimensions of broader issues; collaboration with scientists, resource managers, and/or community organizations; integrated action elements; and intentional measurement/reporting structures. Those themes suggest program development and documentation ideas as well as further opportunities for productive research-implementation spaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ardoin","given":"Nicole M."},{"family":"Bowers","given":"Alison W."},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Estelle"}],"container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108224","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108224","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Environmental education outcomes for conservation: A systematic review","title-short":"Environmental education outcomes for conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719307116","volume":"241"},

  {"id":"hanDeepChallengesChina2016","abstract":"China's Central government has released an ambitious plan to tackle the nation's water pollution crisis. However, this is inhibited by a lack of data, particularly for groundwater. We compiled and analyzed water quality classification data from publicly available government sources, further revealing the scale and extent of the crisis. We also compiled nitrate data in shallow and deep groundwater from a range of literature sources, covering 52 of China's groundwater systems; the most comprehensive national-scale assessment yet. Nitrate pollution at levels exceeding the US EPA's maximum contaminant level (10 mg/L NO3N) occurs at the 90th percentile in 25 of 36 shallow aquifers and 10 out of 37 deep or karst aquifers. Isotopic compositions of groundwater nitrate (δ15N and δ18ONO3 values ranging from −14.9‰ to 35.5‰ and −8.1‰ to 51.0‰, respectively) indicate many nitrate sources including soil nitrogen, agricultural fertilizers, untreated wastewater and/or manure, and locally show evidence of de-nitrification. From these data, it is clear that contaminated groundwater is ubiquitous in deep aquifers as well as shallow groundwater (and surface water). Deep aquifers contain water recharged tens of thousands of years before present, long before widespread anthropogenic nitrate contamination. This groundwater has therefore likely been contaminated due to rapid bypass flow along wells or other conduits. Addressing the issue of well condition is urgently needed to stop further pollution of China's deep aquifers, which are some of China's most important drinking water sources. China's new 10-point Water Pollution Plan addresses previous shortcomings, however, control and remediation of deep groundwater pollution will take decades of sustained effort.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Dongmei"},{"family":"Currell","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Cao","given":"Guoliang"}],"container-title":"Environmental Pollution","container-title-short":"Environmental Pollution","DOI":"10.1016/j.envpol.2016.08.078","ISSN":"0269-7491","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1222-1233","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Deep challenges for China's war on water pollution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116310363","volume":"218"},

  {"id":"ochooAssociationPerceptionsPublic2017","abstract":"Studying public perception on drinking water quality is crucial for managing of water resources, generation of water quality standards, and surveillance of the drinking-water quality. However, in policy discourse, the reliability of public perception concerning drinking water quality and associated health risks is questionable. Does the public perception of water quality equate with the actual water quality? We investigated public perceptions of water quality and the perceived health risks and associated with the actual quality of public water supplies in the same communities. The study was conducted in 45 communities of Newfoundland (Canada) in 2012. First, a telephone survey of 100 households was conducted to examine public perceptions of drinking water quality of their respective public sources. Then we extracted public water quality reports of the same communities (1988–2011) from the provincial government's water resources portal. These reports contained the analysis of 2091 water samples, including levels of Disinfection By-Products (DBPs), nutrients, metals, ions and physical parameters. The reports showed that colour, manganese, total dissolved solids, iron, turbidity, and DBPs were the major detected parameters in the public water. However, the majority of the respondents (>56%) were either completely satisfied or very satisfied with the quality of drinking water. Older, higher educated and high-income group respondents were more satisfied with water quality than the younger, less educated and low-income group respondents. The study showed that there was no association with public satisfaction level and actual water quality of the respective communities. Even, in the communities, supplied by the same water system, the respondents had differences in opinion. Despite the effort by the provincial government to make the water-test results available on its website for years, the study showed existing disconnectedness between public perception of drinking water quality and actual quality. We had little scope to explore the possible explanations, and hence further studies are required to verify the age, gender educational status and income differential about the satisfaction of public service like water supply.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ochoo","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Valcour","given":"James"},{"family":"Sarkar","given":"Atanu"}],"container-title":"Environmental Research","container-title-short":"Environmental Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.019","ISSN":"0013-9351","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"435-443","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Association between perceptions of public drinking water quality and actual drinking water quality: A community-based exploratory study in Newfoundland (Canada)","title-short":"Association between perceptions of public drinking water quality and actual drinking water quality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935117312653","volume":"159"},
  {"id":"okumahWhatMattersMost2020","abstract":"The need to integrate stakeholders’ views into environmental policy is increasingly gaining attention because this offers the opportunity to design sustainable and synergistic environmental strategies. Understanding and integrating the views of resource users into policy design and implementation could help address the most important challenges, gain community support, enhance project ownership, and avoid policies being rejected by local people. As a result, research in environmental management has focussed on stakeholders’ perceptions of river water quality and how to integrate such views into policy. While existing studies offer insights into the different ways in which stakeholders evaluate river water quality and potential factors influencing judgements, they appear to be limited in a number of ways. First, most of these studies focus on developed countries and may have limited contextual relevance to the developing world. Moreover, past studies focus on segments of society such as farmers and mainly on wastewater for agriculture. These shortcomings may limit our understanding of the topic and our ability to design effective policies to address water quality problems. Drawing on survey data from the Wenchi municipality in Ghana, we examine public perceptions of what constitute important measures of river water quality as well as factors influencing such judgements. Results suggest that while variables such as taste, colour, smell and litter are important, the presence of faecal matter in and/or around the river was rated the most important measure of river water quality while depth of river was the least important. Results further suggest that education, age, number of years a person had lived in a community, depth of river and the presence of aquatic vegetation influence water quality judgements. The findings of this research provide insights into what policymakers and regulators need to consider when attempting to influence behaviours in relation to water resources. We note, however, that while public perceptions of river water quality could guide water management policies, scientific measurements of water quality must not be replaced with stakeholder perceptions. This is because aspects such as ecological integrity may not be important to segments of the public but are an important aspect of water management. This is reinforced in the present study as there seems to be a lack of concern among the participants regarding river depth – an important factor for habitat provision and pollution dilution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Okumah","given":"Murat"},{"family":"Yeboah","given":"Ata Senior"},{"family":"Bonyah","given":"Sylvester Kwaku"}],"container-title":"Land Use Policy","container-title-short":"Land Use Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104824","ISSN":"0264-8377","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"104824","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What matters most?

  {"id":"tangEstimationAwarenessPerception2013","abstract":"This paper applies a structural equation model (SEM) to analyze the formation of awareness and perception of water scarcity, based on a cross-sectional dataset of 446 farmers in the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi Province, China. We find that age, percentage of time spent on farming and social network are the main determinants of awareness. Water price and drought experience are the most important explanatory variables of perception. In addition, awareness and perception strongly interact. The results obtained in this paper are relevant for policymaking, since environmental behavior, which includes efficient use of natural resources, tends to improve if supported by internalization of social norms, which in its turn, is promoted by awareness and perception. From the analysis it follows that spreading information via social networks, rather than via the media, is an important vehicle to enhance awareness and perception and thus to improve irrigation water use efficiency. Special attention should be paid to part-time farmers who are limited in directly perceiving water scarcity. Finally, more use should be made of the price mechanism to strengthen perception and awareness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Jianjun"},{"family":"Folmer","given":"Henk"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Jianhong"}],"container-title":"Journal of Environmental Management","container-title-short":"Journal of Environmental Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.03.051","ISSN":"0301-4797","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,15]]},"language":"en","page":"55-62","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Estimation of awareness and perception of water scarcity among farmers in the Guanzhong Plain, China, by means of a structural equation model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479713002235","volume":"126"},
  {"id":"teetsPowerPolicyNetworks2018","abstract":"In this article, I examine how civil society organizations (CSOs) in China created policy networks among government officials to change environmental policies. I contend that these networks work in similar ways to those in democracies, despite the focus in the literature on how policymaking in authoritarian regimes lacks societal participation. China adopted strict regulations to control CSOs by requiring registration with a supervisory agency. However, CSOs exploit the regulations to use the supervisory agency as an access point to policymakers whom they otherwise could not reach. I use case studies to demonstrate how the strategies used to construct policy networks determined their success in changing policy. This finding represents an initial step in theorizing bottom-up sources of policymaking in authoritarian regimes given that these regimes all create mechanisms for government control over CSOs, have difficulty accessing good information for policymaking from society, and a policy process formally closed to citizen participation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Teets","given":"Jessica"}],"container-title":"Governance","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12280","ISSN":"1468-0491","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gove.12280","page":"125-141","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The power of policy networks in authoritarian regimes: Changing environmental policy in China","title-short":"The power of policy networks in authoritarian regimes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gove.12280","volume":"31"},

(2018). 2018 Environmental Performance Index. New Haven, CT: Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy. https://epi.yale.edu/\n\nThe world has entered a new era of data-driven environmental policymaking. With the UN’s 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, governments are increasingly being asked to explain their performance on a range of pollution control and natural resource management challenges with reference to quantitative metrics. A more data-driven and empirical approach to environmental protection promises to make it easier to spot problems, track trends, highlight policy successes and failures, identify best practices, and optimize the gains from investments in environmental protection. For twenty years the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University have developed comparable country-level indices of environmental sustainability and performance. The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) rankings indicate which countries are doing best against the array of environmental pressures that every nation faces. From a policy perspective, greater value derives from drilling down into the data to analyze performance by specific issue, policy category, peer group, and country. Such an analysis can assist in refining policy choices, understanding the determinants of environmental progress, and maximizing the return on governmental investments.","author":[{"family":"Wendling","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Emerson","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Esty","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Levy","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Sherbinin","given":"Alex","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.34995.12328","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,23]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"2018 Environmental Performance Index (EPI)","type":"book"},

Since the start of the ecological and environmental protection in 1972, China has witnessed “great leaps” of reform on environmental management system about once every 10 years, in order to address the prominent environmental issues at different development stages, and continuously reform, innovate and develop the ecological and environmental governance systems and modes with Chinese characteristics. China adheres to solve environmental problems in the process of development, takes the improvement of the ecological and environmental quality as the core task, and gradually builds its ecological and environmental management systems conforming to the characteristics of different development stages, including a sound ecological and environmental planning & policy system, an improved ecological and environmental governance system and a complete ecological and environmental legal system. During the process of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, we should aim at the strategic goal of building a Beautiful China, keep focused on China while stay connected with the world, adhere to green development, accomplish top-level design, build a new pattern of ecological and environmental management system, and co-construct a clean and beautiful world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Zhenhua"}],"container-title":"Environmental Science and Ecotechnology","container-title-short":"Environmental Science and Ecotechnology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ese.2019.100001","ISSN":"2666-4984","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100001","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"China’s historical evolution of environmental protection along with the forty years’ reform and opening-up","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666498419300018","volume":"1"},
