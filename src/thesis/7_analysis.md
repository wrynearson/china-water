# Analysis
## Results

The following is a summary of the results of the analysis. The code and procedure can be referred to in the #appendix section.

### Hypothesis 1: Worse local (provincial) water quality (`score` increases) relates to an increased perception of severity of water quality issues (`l14d` decreases)

$n = 3253$. The results are inconclusive. Wait for more analysis.

### ### H2 - An increase knowledge of water quality issues (`l2409`) relates to an increased perception of severity (`l14d`)

$n=861$. There appears to be a relationship between water quality knowledge and perception. Respondents who replied incorrectly (when `l2409` equals 1) ($n=282$) have a mean perception response of 2.383, while respondents who replied correctly (when `l2409` equals 2) ($n=579$) have a mean perception response of 2.197.

With increased water quality knowledge `l2409==2`, environmental perception is increased (decreased `l14d`). However, this trend is no longer visible when factoring for rural/urban `a91`, education level `a7a`, and for other demographic question. For more conclusive results
