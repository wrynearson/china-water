Access to freshwater is something many people take for granted. Simply turning on the tap or buying a bottle of water makes it easy to  underappreciated the immense value of clean freshwater. Water is essential for almost all aspects of modern civilization and is connected to all three pillars of sustainable development – environment, society, and the economy.

While water is a permanent resource, water that is usable and consumable by humans is not. Globally, only 2.5 percent of the Earth's  water is non-saline, with most of the remaining freshwater being inaccessibly located in glaciers, ice caps or permafrost. [@shiklomanovWorldFreshwaterResources1993] 

Water scarcity, being the scarcity of availability or access to usable freshwater resources, is a significant and increasing global issue. [@un-waterWaterScarcity] Globally, water usage has increased at a rate of 1.7 times the rate of population increase over the past century. [@f.a.o.AQUASTAT2014] Water stress and scarcity can be caused by increased water withdrawal, population increase, and climate, amongst others. [@f.a.o.AQUASTAT2014] Water scarcity is three dimensional, including physical, infrastructural and institutional factors. [@f.a.o.FoodAgricultureOrganization2011] While some regions are affected more than others, every continent is affected. Four billion people experience extreme water scarcity at least one month out of the year. [@mekonnenFourBillionPeople2016]

The implications of water scarcity cannot be understated. Global water crises stemming from water scarcity are predicted to be the largest risk globally within the next decade. [@worldeconomicforumGlobalRisksReport2016] Since water is vital for human existence, a lack of water can be directly or indirectly related to almost any societal indicator.

One direct impact of water scarcity can come in the form of food production. Globally, 70 percent of global renewable water resources withdrawn for human use is used for agriculture. [@f.a.o.FoodAgricultureOrganization2011] Affected by population growth and the increased consumption of more water-intensive food due partially to economic development, it is estimated that food  production must increase by 70 percent to meet demand. [@f.a.o.FoodAgricultureOrganization2011] Another impact is health. Health can be affected by the quantity and quality of water. The impacts of dehydration, water-borne diseases, and consumption of polluted water are well documented. A third impact is economic. By 2050, some regions could see a GDP growth rate decline of up to six percent due to “losses in agriculture, health, income, and property” caused by water scarcity. [@theworldbankHighDryClimate2016]

## Chinese Shortage

Water issues in China are especially prevalent. On average, China’s renewable freshwater resources were 2,062 cubic meters per capita in 2014, a decrease from 4,200 cubic meters in 1962 and far less than the half of the world average in those respective years. [@f.a.o.AQUASTATMainDatabase2016] China’s renewable freshwater resources are also highly location dependent. For example, only 19.7 percent of total internal renewable surface water and 30 percent of groundwater resources reside in northern China. [@f.a.o.AQUASTATCountryProfile2011] Northern China’s renewable freshwater access is only 757 square meters per capita per year, far below the water scarcity limit of 1,000 square  meters per capita per year. [@zhangEnvironmentalHealthChina2010]

## Chinese Pollution

In addition to the already strained water resource problem, poor water quality caused by pollution is amplifying the problem and is causing further economic, societal and environmental problems. Roughly 80 percent of groundwater resources were found to be unsafe for human contact. [@jing80CentGroundwater2016] Economic costs attributed to poor water quality in 2003 were over 1.16% of GDP. [@wuWaterPollutionHuman1999]

Historically, and especially since the Opening Up and Reform era post-1978, the Chinese government has prioritized economic growth over environmental protection. #cite In terms of water resource management, the government’s investment strategies have prioritized large scale water infrastructure projects over environmentally-friendly pollution-control policies, due to a variety of political and non-political reasons. [@rogersPoliticsWaterReview2017] Mao Zedong famously embraced the idea of the now-partially-completed South-North Water Transfer Project, one of the largest infrastructure endeavors in history, by saying “The south has plenty of water and the north lacks it, so if possible why not borrow some?” [@reutersFACTBOXFactsChina2009]

In addition to having the political will and prowess to pursue economic development, Chinese leadership has also at times shown a campaign-style action to mitigate environmental pollution. One such example was the substantial air quality improvements in Beijing during the 2008 summer Olympics. [@zhangEnvironmentalHealthChina2010] However, similar outcomes regarding improved water quality have not been as positive. Analysis of water quality trends has been hampered partially due to data limitations, including public accessibility, the scope of measurement, and technological limitations including long latency periods. [@zhangEnvironmentalHealthChina2010]

Recently, further policy has been implemented to address water scarcity and pollution issues. In 2015, the State Council released an ambitious attempt to do this, colloquially known as the “Water Ten Plan,” which sets water quality-related goals to be met by 2020. [@guowuyuan.GuoWuYuanGuanYuYinFaShuiWuRanFangZhiXingDongJiHuaDeTongZhi2015] However, results so far have been mixed, with nearly half of all provinces missing their water quality targets in 2017. [@greenpeaceShiErWu2017] One factor which may help this progress, and one of the goals outlined in the Water Ten plan, is the improvement of water quality sensing technology and data management.

## Environmental Policy, Education and Perception

Water quality and quantity issues in China and abroad sit within the context of environmental policy, environmental education, and societies' perception of the two. [@caldwell1990international]

### Environmental Policy

Environmental Policy has a long and global history, at times being documented since the 12th century. 

### Environmental Education

Environmental Education (EE) has been inexorably tied to environmental protection and policy - one of its main goals is "Awareness - to help social groups and individuals acquire an awareness and sensitivity to the total environment and its allied problems." [@IntergovernmentalConferenceEnvironmental] An earlier definition was presented in 1969 from the United States, and has proved reliable and accurate since:

> **Environmental education** is aimed at producing a citizenry that is **knowledgeable** concerning the biophysical environment and its associated problems, aware of **how** to help solve these problems, and **motivated** to work towards their solution. [@stapp1969concept]

Progress continued with development and deployment of EE the international level, with many landmark events in environmentalism and sustainability putting EE at their core, including The International Environmental Education Program (IEEP 1975), the World Conservation Strategy (IUCN 1980), 'Tbilisi Plus Ten' (1987), Our Common Future (WCED 1987), and The Earth Summit (UNCED). [@nealHandbookEnvironmentalEducation2003, p13-15]

EE also has the potential for direct and indirect positive environmental impacts. One study reviewed 105 EE studies which emphasized conservation outcomes, and found that EE programs which included and focused on ecological indicators (such as improved water quality) had outcomes with the most directness (as opposed to indirect impact categories such as community capacity building), and concluded that local aspects of regional and global problems are important for the directness of the link. [@ardoinEnvironmentalEducationOutcomes2020]

While there is a longer document environmental protection movement in the United States than in China, it is important to note that Dr. Stapp wrote this definition with the perspective that only 50 years had passed since much of the nation was rural and underdeveloped. It can be argued that China shares this temporal perspective today.

### Environmental Society (Perception)

### In China

Despite its international perception (often correct) of poor environmental protection, China does have a long history of environmental policy, with "great leaps" of progress and reform every decade or so since the political reform in the early 1970s. [@xieChinaHistoricalEvolution2020] #check-source There is also evidence showing that environmental issues and their repercussions are deemed important by the local population. One study found that Chinese university student were more concerned about environmental risk, and deemed "environmental issues to be more harmful to health, to the environment, and to social economic development of the nation than did the American respondents.environmental issues to be more harmful to health, to the environment, and to social economic development of the nation than did the American respondents." [@duanCrossCulturalStudyEnvironmental2012] Furthermore, they found that Chinese students were concerned about fresh water shortage, and safe drinking water shortage more than other environmental concerns, and only less so than human population growth.

## Water Quality and Perception

### Factors in Water Quality 

**Talk about components of water quality, aesthetics, harmful vs. non-harmful components, local and global rankings, drinking vs using, etc.**

China often cites its developing country status as a reason that it under-performs on environmental indicators. #cite However, China ranks lower than other countries with similar or even lower GDP. [@wendlingz.a.2020EnvironmentalPerformance2020, p. X, fig. ES-1] Overall, China ranked 120th with a score of 37.3 in 2020, which was the same ranking as in 2018 but with a decreased score from 50.74.[^1] [@wendlingz.a.2020EnvironmentalPerformance2020 p. XII; @wendling2018EnvironmentalPerformance2018 p.15] 

In 2020, China ranked 54th (6th regionally) in sanitation and drinking water, with a score of 59.4/100. [@wendlingz.a.2020EnvironmentalPerformance2020, p. 57] Specific rankings for sanitation and drinking water were not available for 2018. For the broader category of Environmental Health (HLT), China scored 31.72/100. [@huangEnvironmentalPerformanceAsia2019]

### Water Quality Perception

While actual water quality is clearly important, so too is perception. Many factors exist in the public's perception of water quality. While "organoleptic properties" exist, most notably flavor, others exist including "risk perception, attitudes towards water chemicals, contextual cues provided by the supply system, familiarity with specific water properties, trust in suppliers, past problems attributed to water quality and information provided by the mass media and interpersonal sources." [@defrancadoriaFactorsInfluencingPublic2010] Water quality perceptions are especially important when water is used for drinking or other domestic purposes, causing some to consider perceptions of water quality more important than actual water quality. [@sheat1992public] Thus, it is important for policy makers to consider not only reality of water quality, but also the public's perception. Trends indicate that water quality policy should include not only the protection of human health, but also "acceptability." [@BonnCharterSafe2004 §7.7]

Research into water quality perception has existed since the 1960s, but is very heterogeneous, including; different use cases of water (drinking, household, agricultural, etc.); different delivery methods (piped, bottled) and different geographic and demographic localities, with most research conducted on bottled water and in developed countries. [@defrancadoriaFactorsInfluencingPublic2010] 

One study represented research in an under-studied theme and demographic. Stakeholders' perceptions of important measures of river water quality in one region of Ghana suggest that in developing countries (or regions with lower objective water quality), faecal matter in and around rivers, and presence of plastic waste in rivers was deemed to be the most important measure, followed by the smell, clarity, color, and taste ("organoleptic properties") of the water. [@okumahWhatMattersMost2020, fig. 3]

### Linking the Two



—

China's political situation does not negate the impact that society can have on environmental policy. One study found that Chinese civil society organizations (CSOs) work in similar ways to those in more liberal and democratic countries. [@teetsPowerPolicyNetworks2018]

—

Multiple factors drive environmental perception. One study found that "age, percentage of time spent on farming and social network are the main determinants of awareness" and perception of water scarcity in the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi Province, China. [@tangEstimationAwarenessPerception2013]

[^1]: The framework of the overall EPI score is comprehensive and weighs 32 indicators. However, the weighting of some indicators changed between 2018 and 2020, making comparison difficult. The visualization of each years breakdown can be seen in 2018 [@wendling2018EnvironmentalPerformance2018, p. 6, fig. 2.1] and 2020 [@wendlingz.a.2020EnvironmentalPerformance2020, p. XI, fig. ES-2].
