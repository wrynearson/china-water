  {"id":"ardoinEnvironmentalEducationOutcomes2020","abstract":"Effective environmental education represents more than a unidirectional transfer of information: rather, this suite of tools develops and enhances environmental attitudes, values, and knowledge, as well as builds skills that prepare individuals and communities to collaboratively undertake positive environmental action. Environmental education also facilitates connections between actionable research findings and on-the-ground practices, creating synergistic spaces where stakeholders collaborate to address dynamic environmental issues over time. Because of this commitment to application and iteration, environmental education can result in direct benefits to the environment and address conservation issues concretely. Yet, the path to achieving those tangible impacts can be winding, with robust data documenting changes challenging to produce. To better understand the research-implementation spaces where those environmental education outcomes occur, are measured, and are reported, we undertook a systematic review of research on environmental education's contributions to conservation and environmental quality outcomes. Given the variation in research designs and data, we used a mixed-methods approach to the review; analysis of the 105 resulting studies documented strongly positive environmental education outcomes overall and highlighted productive research-implementation spaces. Chi-square analyses revealed that programs reporting direct outcomes, compared with those reporting indirect outcomes, differed on primary topic addressed. A narrative analysis indicated that environmental education programs documenting direct impacts included: a focus on localized issues or locally relevant dimensions of broader issues; collaboration with scientists, resource managers, and/or community organizations; integrated action elements; and intentional measurement/reporting structures. Those themes suggest program development and documentation ideas as well as further opportunities for productive research-implementation spaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ardoin","given":"Nicole M."},{"family":"Bowers","given":"Alison W."},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Estelle"}],"container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108224","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108224","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Environmental education outcomes for conservation: A systematic review","title-short":"Environmental education outcomes for conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719307116","volume":"241"},

  {"id":"hanDeepChallengesChina2016","abstract":"China's Central government has released an ambitious plan to tackle the nation's water pollution crisis. However, this is inhibited by a lack of data, particularly for groundwater. We compiled and analyzed water quality classification data from publicly available government sources, further revealing the scale and extent of the crisis. We also compiled nitrate data in shallow and deep groundwater from a range of literature sources, covering 52 of China's groundwater systems; the most comprehensive national-scale assessment yet. Nitrate pollution at levels exceeding the US EPA's maximum contaminant level (10 mg/L NO3N) occurs at the 90th percentile in 25 of 36 shallow aquifers and 10 out of 37 deep or karst aquifers. Isotopic compositions of groundwater nitrate (δ15N and δ18ONO3 values ranging from −14.9‰ to 35.5‰ and −8.1‰ to 51.0‰, respectively) indicate many nitrate sources including soil nitrogen, agricultural fertilizers, untreated wastewater and/or manure, and locally show evidence of de-nitrification. From these data, it is clear that contaminated groundwater is ubiquitous in deep aquifers as well as shallow groundwater (and surface water). Deep aquifers contain water recharged tens of thousands of years before present, long before widespread anthropogenic nitrate contamination. This groundwater has therefore likely been contaminated due to rapid bypass flow along wells or other conduits. Addressing the issue of well condition is urgently needed to stop further pollution of China's deep aquifers, which are some of China's most important drinking water sources. China's new 10-point Water Pollution Plan addresses previous shortcomings, however, control and remediation of deep groundwater pollution will take decades of sustained effort.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Dongmei"},{"family":"Currell","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Cao","given":"Guoliang"}],"container-title":"Environmental Pollution","container-title-short":"Environmental Pollution","DOI":"10.1016/j.envpol.2016.08.078","ISSN":"0269-7491","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1222-1233","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Deep challenges for China's war on water pollution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116310363","volume":"218"},

We find that age, percentage of time spent on farming and social network are the main determinants of awareness. Water price and drought experience are the most important explanatory variables of perception. In addition, awareness and perception strongly interact. The results obtained in this paper are relevant for policymaking, since environmental behavior, which includes efficient use of natural resources, tends to improve if supported by internalization of social norms, which in its turn, is promoted by awareness and perception. From the analysis it follows that spreading information via social networks, rather than via the media, is an important vehicle to enhance awareness and perception and thus to improve irrigation water use efficiency. Special attention should be paid to part-time farmers who are limited in directly perceiving water scarcity. Finally, more use should be made of the price mechanism to strengthen perception and awareness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Jianjun"},{"family":"Folmer","given":"Henk"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Jianhong"}],"container-title":"Journal of Environmental Management","container-title-short":"Journal of Environmental Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.03.051","ISSN":"0301-4797","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,15]]},"language":"en","page":"55-62","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Estimation of awareness and perception of water scarcity among farmers in the Guanzhong Plain, China, by means of a structural equation model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479713002235","volume":"126"},
  {"id":"teetsPowerPolicyNetworks2018","abstract":"In this article, I examine how civil society organizations (CSOs) in China created policy networks among government officials to change environmental policies. I contend that these networks work in similar ways to those in democracies, despite the focus in the literature on how policymaking in authoritarian regimes lacks societal participation. China adopted strict regulations to control CSOs by requiring registration with a supervisory agency. However, CSOs exploit the regulations to use the supervisory agency as an access point to policymakers whom they otherwise could not reach. I use case studies to demonstrate how the strategies used to construct policy networks determined their success in changing policy. This finding represents an initial step in theorizing bottom-up sources of policymaking in authoritarian regimes given that these regimes all create mechanisms for government control over CSOs, have difficulty accessing good information for policymaking from society, and a policy process formally closed to citizen participation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Teets","given":"Jessica"}],"container-title":"Governance","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12280","ISSN":"1468-0491","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gove.12280","page":"125-141","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The power of policy networks in authoritarian regimes: Changing environmental policy in China","title-short":"The power of policy networks in authoritarian regimes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gove.12280","volume":"31"},
