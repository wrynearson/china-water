<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Access to freshwater is something many people take for granted. Simply turning on the tap or buying a bottle of water makes it easy to underappreciated the immense value of clean freshwater. Water is essential for almost all aspects of modern civilization and is connected to all three pillars of sustainable development – environment, society, and the economy.</p>
<p>While water is a permanent resource, water that is usable and consumable by humans is not. Globally, only 2.5 percent of the Earth’s water is non-saline, with most of the remaining freshwater being inaccessibly located in glaciers, ice caps or permafrost. <span class="citation" data-cites="shiklomanovWorldFreshwaterResources1993">(Shiklomanov 1993)</span></p>
<p>Water scarcity, being the scarcity of availability or access to usable freshwater resources, is a significant and increasing global issue. <span class="citation" data-cites="un-waterWaterScarcity">(UN-Water n.d.)</span> Globally, water usage has increased at a rate of 1.7 times the rate of population increase over the past century. <span class="citation" data-cites="f.a.o.AQUASTAT2014">(F.A.O. 2014)</span> Water stress and scarcity can be caused by increased water withdrawal, population increase, and climate, amongst others. <span class="citation" data-cites="f.a.o.AQUASTAT2014">(F.A.O. 2014)</span> Water scarcity is three dimensional, including physical, infrastructural and institutional factors. <span class="citation" data-cites="f.a.o.FoodAgricultureOrganization2011">(F.A.O. 2011b)</span> While some regions are affected more than others, every continent is affected. Four billion people experience extreme water scarcity at least one month out of the year. <span class="citation" data-cites="mekonnenFourBillionPeople2016">(Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2016)</span></p>
<p>The implications of water scarcity cannot be understated. Global water crises stemming from water scarcity are predicted to be the largest risk globally within the next decade. <span class="citation" data-cites="worldeconomicforumGlobalRisksReport2016">(World Economic Forum 2016)</span> Since water is vital for human existence, a lack of water can be directly or indirectly related to almost any societal indicator.</p>
<p>One direct impact of water scarcity can come in the form of food production. Globally, 70 percent of global renewable water resources withdrawn for human use is used for agriculture. <span class="citation" data-cites="f.a.o.FoodAgricultureOrganization2011">(F.A.O. 2011b)</span> Affected by population growth and the increased consumption of more water-intensive food due partially to economic development, it is estimated that food production must increase by 70 percent to meet demand. <span class="citation" data-cites="f.a.o.FoodAgricultureOrganization2011">(F.A.O. 2011b)</span> Another impact is health. Health can be affected by the quantity and quality of water. The impacts of dehydration, water-borne diseases, and consumption of polluted water are well documented. A third impact is economic. By 2050, some regions could see a GDP growth rate decline of up to six percent due to “losses in agriculture, health, income, and property” caused by water scarcity. <span class="citation" data-cites="theworldbankHighDryClimate2016">(The World Bank 2016)</span></p>
<h2 id="in-china">In China</h2>
<p>Water issues in China are especially prevalent. On average, China’s renewable freshwater resources were 2,062 cubic meters per capita in 2014, a decrease from 4,200 cubic meters in 1962 and far less than the half of the world average in those respective years. <span class="citation" data-cites="f.a.o.AQUASTATMainDatabase2016">(F.A.O. 2016)</span> China’s renewable freshwater resources are also highly location dependent. For example, only 19.7 percent of total internal renewable surface water and 30 percent of groundwater resources reside in northern China. <span class="citation" data-cites="f.a.o.AQUASTATCountryProfile2011">(F.A.O. 2011a)</span> Northern China’s renewable freshwater access is only 757 square meters per capita per year, far below the water scarcity limit of 1,000 square meters per capita per year. <span class="citation" data-cites="zhangEnvironmentalHealthChina2010">(Zhang et al. 2010)</span></p>
<p>In addition to the already strained water resource problem, poor water quality caused by pollution is amplifying the problem and is causing further economic, societal and environmental problems. Roughly 80 percent of groundwater resources were found to be unsafe for human contact. <span class="citation" data-cites="jing80CentGroundwater2016">(Jing 2016)</span> Economic costs attributed to poor water quality in 2003 were over 1.16% of GDP. <span class="citation" data-cites="wuWaterPollutionHuman1999">(Wu et al. 1999)</span></p>
<p>Historically, and especially since the Opening Up and Reform era post-1978, the Chinese government has prioritized economic growth over environmental protection. In terms of water resource management, the government’s investment strategies have prioritized large scale water infrastructure projects over environmentally-friendly pollution-control policies, due to a variety of political and non-political reasons. <span class="citation" data-cites="rogersPoliticsWaterReview2017">(Rogers and Crow-Miller 2017)</span> Mao Zedong famously embraced the idea of the now-partially-completed South-North Water Transfer Project, one of the largest infrastructure endeavors in history, by saying “The south has plenty of water and the north lacks it, so if possible why not borrow some?” <span class="citation" data-cites="reutersFACTBOXFactsChina2009">(Reuters 2009)</span></p>
<p>In addition to having the political will and prowess to pursue economic development, Chinese leadership has also at times shown a campaign-style action to mitigate environmental pollution. One such example was the substantial air quality improvements in Beijing during the 2008 summer Olympics. <span class="citation" data-cites="zhangEnvironmentalHealthChina2010">(Zhang et al. 2010)</span> However, similar outcomes regarding improved water quality have not been as positive. Analysis of water quality trends has been hampered partially due to data limitations, including public accessibility, the scope of measurement, and technological limitations including long latency periods. <span class="citation" data-cites="zhangEnvironmentalHealthChina2010">(Zhang et al. 2010)</span></p>
<p>Recently, further policy has been implemented to address water scarcity and pollution issues. In 2015, the State Council released an ambitious attempt to do this, colloquially known as the “Water Ten Plan,” which sets water quality-related goals to be met by 2020. <span class="citation" data-cites="guowuyuan.GuoWuYuanGuanYuYinFaShuiWuRanFangZhiXingDongJiHuaDeTongZhi2015">(国务院. 2015)</span> However, results so far have been mixed, with nearly half of all provinces missing their water quality targets in 2017. <span class="citation" data-cites="greenpeaceShiErWu2017">(Greenpeace 2017)</span> One factor which may help this progress, and one of the goals outlined in the Water Ten plan, is the improvement of water quality sensing technology and data management.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Water pollution is a well-document issue both in China and abroad. Improvements in both water quality and availability of water quality data in recent years. However, less attention has been paid to Chinese citizens’ knowledge about and perception of water quality. It is easily assumed that perception of water quality would be based on the real water quality – i.e., if water quality is good, then people perceive it to be good, while if water quality is bad, then people perceive it to be bad. However, this may not be the case. Divergence between perception and reality, or delays in reality driving perception could be important for policy makers in whether their resource-intensive campaign-style water quality reforms are the most effective policy tool, in regards to finance, behavior change or political support. From a political and social science perspective, perception of water quality could be more important in decision making than actual water quality. <span class="citation" data-cites="coughlinPerceptionValuationWater1976">(Coughlin 1976, 206)</span> These policy implication could easily be multifaceted, and could reveal further discrepancies between social groups and geographic regions, which could lead to decreased political effectiveness. <span class="citation" data-cites="larsonDivergentPerspectivesWater2009">(Larson et al. 2009)</span></p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<h2 id="environmental-policy-knowledge-and-perception">Environmental Policy, Knowledge and Perception</h2>
<p>Water quality and quantity issues in China and abroad sit within the context of environmental policy, environmental education, and societies’ perception of the two. <span class="citation" data-cites="caldwell1990international">(Caldwell and others 1990)</span> Analysis linking environmental knowledge and attitudes (perception) have existed for decades. The assumption, and common model, is that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“increased knowledge leads to favorable attitudes towards pollution abatement which in turn lead to an action promoting environmental quality.” <span class="citation" data-cites="ramseyEnvironmentalKnowledgeAttitudes1976">(Ramsey and Rickson 1976)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time, in the 1970s, most scholars agreed with this model, concluding that “a broad public literacy of biological and ecological concepts is at the heart of defining, reclaiming, and maintaining environmental quality,” but also concedes that the results of education are variable. <span class="citation" data-cites="ramseyEnvironmentalKnowledgeAttitudes1976">(Ramsey and Rickson 1976)</span></p>
<p>Understanding the background of environmental policy, knowledge, education and perception is important in understanding how they interact in the concept of water quality in China and abroad.</p>
<p>Several definitions are adapted for this thesis, and for the following sections. These are all defined by <span class="citation" data-cites="sudarmadiSurveyPerceptionKnowledge2001">(Sudarmadi et al. 2001)</span>, in a study which is discussed later. <strong>Environmental awareness</strong> is “the attention and concern (mindful and heedful) of individuals to environment problems.” <strong>Environmental perception</strong> is “the recognition of [an environmental issue] as a problem, based on memory and prior experience.” These two interact, as perception is “a basic determinant of awareness in that it triggers attention and concern.” <span class="citation" data-cites="endsleyTheorySituationAwareness1995">(Endsley 1995)</span> However, "perception only leads to awareness when it exceeds frequency and intensity thresholds. <span class="citation" data-cites="meriklePerceptionAwarenessPerspectives2001">(Merikle, Smilek, and Eastwood 2001)</span> In the context of environmental issues, perception refers to the state of the environment (or a specific environmental feature) as being problematic, while awareness refers to attention to the issue because of the impacts of a change in usability of the environment. <span class="citation" data-cites="tangEstimationAwarenessPerception2013">(Tang, Folmer, and Xue 2013, sec. 2.1.2)</span></p>
<h3 id="environmental-policy">Environmental Policy</h3>
<p>Environmental conservation has a long and global history, at times being documented as early as the seventh century, with examples afterwards often being local or anecdotal. <span class="citation" data-cites="StCuthbertFather2013">(<em>BBC News</em> 2013)</span> In the broader context of environmental appreciation or dependency, the history likely goes back to the dawn of humanity. This is evident in written and modern-day history as some indigenous cultures do not separate the environment and the society. <span class="citation" data-cites="armieroHistoryEnvironmentalismLocal2014">(Armiero and Sedrez 2014, 2–3)</span></p>
<p>Much of the documented history of modern environmentalism and environmental policy comes from the United States. Preservation was one of the first policy instruments, most notably with the Yellowstone National Park Act of 1972 <span class="citation" data-cites="RulesRegulationsYellowstone1881">(<span>“Rules and regulations of the Yellowstone national park. Department of the interior.”</span> 1881)</span> Water pollution was one of the first environmental issues which received federal legislation with the The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 <span class="citation" data-cites="ModernEnvironmentalMovement">(<span>“The Modern Environmental Movement | American Experience | PBS”</span> n.d.)</span>, which later became known as the Clean Water Act. <span class="citation" data-cites="usepaHistoryCleanWater2013">(US EPA 2013)</span></p>
<p>Another related field of study is Environmental history, which “studies the mutual relationships of humans and nature through time.” <span class="citation" data-cites="hughesWhatEnvironmentalHistory2016">(Hughes 2016, 1)</span> This field of study, a subset of the field of history, aims to link and remind historical significance of the link between humans and nature. Environmental historians aim to “see human events within the context where they happen, and that is the entire natural environment.” <span class="citation" data-cites="hughesWhatEnvironmentalHistory2016">(Hughes 2016, 2)</span> This has relevance to policy makers worldwide and in China.</p>
<p>Despite much of the literature covering history in the United States, environmental protection can be seen as a global phenomenon in many parts of the world and throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, albeit with differing impact, scope and timeliness. The link to its global nature is highlighted in a study which finds that international organizations and communities have central importance in the diffusion of one particular type of environmental policy, the Environmental Impact Assessment, and its particular importance for less-developed countries. <span class="citation" data-cites="hironakaGlobalizationEnvironmentalProtection2002">(Hironaka 2002)</span></p>
<h3 id="environmental-knowledge-and-education">Environmental Knowledge and Education</h3>
<p>Knowledge about most topics is learned through theory (education) and practice (experience). This is no different with the environment. The term ‘Environmental Knowledge’ accounts for multiple ways of learning and acquisition. In the 1970s, authors stressed the complicated pathways from information to knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…the acquisition of environmental knowledge involves a complicated series of processes – sensation, perception, imagery, retention, recall, reasoning, problem solving, judgment, and evaluation. It is an individual process, each person having a unique cognition of the world, but the overlap in images among individuals permits environmental communication.” <span class="citation" data-cites="holcombReviewEnvironmentalKnowing1977">(Holcomb 1977)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Environmental Education (EE) is a subset of Environmental Knowledge and is inexorably tied to environmental protection and policy One of its main goals is “Awareness - to help social groups and individuals acquire an awareness and sensitivity to the total environment and its allied problems.” <span class="citation" data-cites="IntergovernmentalConferenceEnvironmental">(<span>“Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education, Tbilisi, USSR, 14-26 October 1977: Final Report - UNESCO Digital Library”</span> n.d.)</span> An earlier definition was presented in 1969 from the United States, and has proved reliable and accurate since:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Environmental education</strong> is aimed at producing a citizenry that is <strong>knowledgeable</strong> concerning the biophysical environment and its associated problems, aware of <strong>how</strong> to help solve these problems, and <strong>motivated</strong> to work towards their solution. <span class="citation" data-cites="stapp1969concept">(Stapp et al. 1969)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there is a longer document environmental protection movement in the United States than in China, it is important to note that Dr. Stapp wrote this definition with the perspective that only 50 years had passed since much of the United States was rural and underdeveloped. It can be argued that China shares this temporal perspective today.</p>
<p>Progress continued with development and deployment of EE the international level, with many landmark events in environmentalism and sustainability putting EE at their core, including The International Environmental Education Program (IEEP 1975), the World Conservation Strategy (IUCN 1980), ‘Tbilisi Plus Ten’ (1987), Our Common Future (WCED 1987), and The Earth Summit (UNCED). <span class="citation" data-cites="nealHandbookEnvironmentalEducation2003">(Neal and Palmer 2003, p13–15)</span></p>
<p>EE also has the potential for direct and indirect positive environmental impacts. One study reviewed 105 EE studies which emphasized conservation outcomes, and found that EE programs which included and focused on ecological indicators (such as improved water quality) had outcomes with the most directness (as opposed to indirect impact categories such as community capacity building), and concluded that local aspects of regional and global problems are important for the directness of the link. <span class="citation" data-cites="ardoinEnvironmentalEducationOutcomes2020">(Ardoin, Bowers, and Gaillard 2020)</span></p>
<p>Several other studies have mixed results. One study examined the relationship between environmental knowledge and attitudes of fourth-graders in Germany but found no correlation between the two. <span class="citation" data-cites="lieflanderEducationalImpactRelationship2018">(Liefländer and Bogner 2018)</span> However, the authors noted that the lack of correlation was probably caused by measurement constraints. Another study examined high school students’ environmental knowledge and attitudes and found “significant difference in both knowledge gain and attitudes of students after exposure” where “environmental knowledge scores increased by 22%” after the completion of a 10-day environmental course, and “environmental attitudes became more environmentally favorable.” <span class="citation" data-cites="bradleyRelationshipEnvironmentalKnowledge1999">(Bradley, Waliczek, and Zajicek 1999)</span></p>
<h3 id="environmental-society-perception">Environmental Society (Perception)</h3>
<p>There is an intuitive link between the state of the environment and one’s perception of the environment. Environmental perception has been defined as “awareness of, or feelings about, the environment, and as the act of apprehending the environment by the senses.” <span class="citation" data-cites="zubeEnvironmentalPerception1999">(Zube 1999)</span> A more detailed definition takes into account its multi-dimensional aspects, as a “transactional process between the person and the environment.” <span class="citation" data-cites="ittelsonEnvironmentCognition1973">(Ittelson 1973)</span> He offered three general conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is not directly controlled by the stimulus.</li>
<li>It is linked to and indistinguishable from other aspects of psychological functioning.</li>
<li>It is relevant and appropriate to specific environmental contexts.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Ittelson continues in his theoretical framework and suggest that environments “surround the person, provide opportunities for exploration, and provide information that is received through all senses – feeling, hearing, seeing, smelling, and tasting.” <span class="citation" data-cites="zubeEnvironmentalPerception1999">(Zube 1999, section. Definition)</span> Environments provide more information than the person can apprehend, thus leaving the potential for the environment to influence in unperceivable ways. Additionally, according to Ittleson, environments have ambiance - a “quality, mood or atmosphere” which can relate to the social context of environmental experience, and is viewed through the lens of past experience and current perceptions. Simply put, environments affect both individuals and societal groups in ways which are not always easy to understand, and can change or be affected in the present and the past. This has an affect on policy, as information regarding how the general population feels about the environment can inform policy makers.</p>
<p>While studies into societies’ perception of the environment often focuses on positive aspects when investigating wilderness and landscape aesthetics, studies regarding air, water and sound usually focus on negative factors. <span class="citation" data-cites="zubeEnvironmentalPerception1999">(Zube 1999, section. Air, water, and sound)</span> These studies often focus on maximum levels of pollutants (quantitatively or qualitatively) or annoyance thresholds. Interestingly, different cultures have been found to have different threshold qualitative pollution or annoyance levels, which could be seen as a limitation of this study.</p>
<p>One other factor in environmental perception was the “magnitude, diversity and rapidity of environmental change.” <span class="citation" data-cites="zubeEnvironmentalPerception1999">(Zube 1999, section. Major environmental changes)</span> Studies in this domain indicate that “physical proximity to the change, magnitude and kind of change, length of time in current residence, and personal value orientations are all related to the perception of and response to the phenomenon.” <span class="citation" data-cites="zubeEnvironmentalPerception1999">(Zube 1999, section. Major environmental changes)</span></p>
<h3 id="linking">Linking</h3>
<p>Studies have looked at some of the variables mentioned previously in relation to other demographic data. One study in 1998 “investigated differences in perception, knowledge, awareness and attitude with regard to environmental problems between educated and [non-educated] groups.” <span class="citation" data-cites="sudarmadiSurveyPerceptionKnowledge2001">(Sudarmadi et al. 2001)</span> They found that “subjects in the educated group had better perception, more detailed knowledge, were more aware, and had better attitudes in regard to regional and global environmental problems.”</p>
<h3 id="in-china-1">In China</h3>
<p>Despite its international perception (often correct) of poor environmental protection, China does have history of concern with environmental degradation. In terms of history, the consensus in China amongst researchers is that while the field of environmental history originated in the United States in the early 1970s, the field came to China in the 1990s, and is now studied by researchers of historical geography, social, economic and world history. <span class="citation" data-cites="hanHistoricalGeographyEnvironmental2016">(Han 2016)</span> While a new and evolving field, the trajectory of study in this area comes from pollution issues in China, which follows trends from the emergence of this study in other countries. <span class="citation" data-cites="hanHistoricalGeographyEnvironmental2016">(Han 2016, 7)</span></p>
<p>In terms of policy, China makes “great leaps” of progress and reform every decade or so since the political reform in the early 1970s. <span class="citation" data-cites="xieChinaHistoricalEvolution2020">(Xie 2020)</span></p>
<p>There is also evidence showing that environmental issues and their repercussions are deemed important by the local population. One study found that Chinese university students were more concerned about environmental risk, and deemed “environmental issues to be more harmful to health, to the environment, and to social economic development of the nation than did the American respondents.environmental issues to be more harmful to health, to the environment, and to social economic development of the nation than did the American respondents.” <span class="citation" data-cites="duanCrossCulturalStudyEnvironmental2012">(Duan and Fortner 2012)</span> Furthermore, they found that Chinese students were concerned about fresh water shortage, and safe drinking water shortage more than other environmental concerns, and only less so than human population growth.</p>

<p>China often cites its developing country status as a reason that it under-performs on environmental indicators.

<p>China’s improvement in water infrastructure has gone on for decades, with particular improvement since 1990 with an increases in municipal water supply utilities coverage from 50% in 1990 to 88% in 2005. <span class="citation" data-cites="browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007">(Browder et al. 2007, xvii)</span> In the same report on infrastructural improvements, the authors repeatedly cite concerns for water quality and quantity issues, citing the problem originating from “outdated water treatment technology and high levels of pollution in the raw water.” <span class="citation" data-cites="browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007">(Browder et al. 2007, 17)</span> The report also states that “Water quality monitoring is generally poor and the data is consequently unreliable,” however this is outdated. <span class="citation" data-cites="browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007">(Browder et al. 2007, 17)</span> The report continues that national policies, including drinking water quality, are only implemented in higher-tier cities and are often loosely enforced. <span class="citation" data-cites="browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007">(Browder et al. 2007, 30)</span> The problem was especially evident in second tier, third tier and non-urban towns, as evident below:</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007">(Browder et al. 2007, 31, tab. 3.1)</span></p>
<p>The report continues, noting a slight increase in average category V or V+ in Chinese rivers from 1991 - 2002. <span class="citation" data-cites="browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007">(Browder et al. 2007, 33, fig. 3.3)</span> It also notes discrepancies between water supply, water quality and public information for residents to judge the quality themselves (i.e. perception), noting that most urban residents do not drink water directly and is first boiled, which is both a cultural tradition and response to “the uncertain quality of the water from the tap.” <span class="citation" data-cites="browderSteppingImprovingPerformance2007">(Browder et al. 2007, 61)</span></p>
<p>China’s water quality faces continued scrutiny in the 2010s. In 2011, as a part of the 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015), China’s central government earmarked almost RMB 700b (roughly US$108b) for water improvement, including water treatment and piping systems. <span class="citation" data-cites="hongqiaoliuChinaLongMarch2015">(Hongqiao LIu 2015, section. Intro)</span> Within this timeline, China’s ‘National Drinking Water Quality Standard’ (GB 5749-2006)’ was aimed to be implemented.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="zhonghuarenmingongheguoguojiaShengHuoYinYongShuiWeiShengBiaoZhun2006">(中华人民共和国国家 2006)</span> While improvements have been made in access to water, the quality of the water is questionable. China has historically been reluctant to release such data - the mid-2013 water quality assessment report was “classified” as of 2015 <span class="citation" data-cites="hongqiaoliuChinaLongMarch2015">(Hongqiao LIu 2015, 4)</span>, and the state of china’s soil pollution was classified as a “state secret” until 2014. <span class="citation" data-cites="hornbyChinaAdmitsWidespread2014">(Hornby 2014)</span> Greenpeace East Asia determined that “Fourteen provinces failed to meet their water quality improvement targets during the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011-2015).” <span class="citation" data-cites="NearlyHalfChinese2017">(<span>“Nearly Half of Chinese Provinces Miss Water Targets, 85% of Shanghai’s River Water Not Fit for Human Contact”</span> 2017)</span> The analysis noted that national progress was made during the first half of the 12th Five-Year Plan period, but ‘flattened off’ beginning in 2013.</p>
<h3 id="water-quality-perception">Water Quality Perception</h3>
<p>While actual water quality is clearly important, so too is perception. Many factors exist in the public’s perception of water quality. While “organoleptic properties” exist, most notably flavor, others exist including “risk perception, attitudes towards water chemicals, contextual cues provided by the supply system, familiarity with specific water properties, trust in suppliers, past problems attributed to water quality and information provided by the mass media and interpersonal sources.” <span class="citation" data-cites="migueldefrancadoriaFactorsInfluencingPublic2010">(Miguel de França Doria 2010)</span> Water quality perceptions are especially important when water is used for drinking or other domestic purposes, causing some to consider perceptions of water quality more important than actual water quality. <span class="citation" data-cites="sheat1992public">(Sheat 1992)</span> Thus, it is important for policy makers to consider not only reality of water quality, but also the public’s perception. Trends indicate that water quality policy should include not only the protection of human health, but also “acceptability.” <span class="citation" data-cites="BonnCharterSafe2004">(<span>“The Bonn Charter for Safe Drinking Water”</span> 2004, sec. 7.7)</span></p>
<p>Research into water quality perception has existed since the 1960s, but is very heterogeneous, including; different use cases of water (drinking, household, agricultural, etc.); different delivery methods (piped, bottled) and different geographic and demographic localities, with most research conducted on bottled water and in developed countries. <span class="citation" data-cites="migueldefrancadoriaFactorsInfluencingPublic2010">(Miguel de França Doria 2010)</span></p>
<p>One study represented research in an under-studied theme and demographic. Stakeholders’ perceptions of important measures of river water quality in one region of Ghana suggest that in developing countries (or regions with lower objective water quality), faecal matter in and around rivers, and presence of plastic waste in rivers was deemed to be the most important measure, followed by the smell, clarity, color, and taste (“organoleptic properties”) of the water. <span class="citation" data-cites="okumahWhatMattersMost2020">(Okumah, Yeboah, and Bonyah 2020, fig. 3)</span></p>
<p>Multiple factors drive perception of environmental issues. In a related issue, water scarcity, one study examined farmers’ (<span class="math inline">\(n = 446\)</span>) awareness and perception of water shortages in irrigation. <span class="citation" data-cites="tangEstimationAwarenessPerception2013">(Tang, Folmer, and Xue 2013)</span> They found that “age, percentage of time spent on farming and social network are the main determinants of awareness,” and that “water price and drought experience are the most important explanatory variables of perception” in the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi Province, China. Furthermore, they found that awareness and perception strongly interact, citing literature which found that households who used less water show a higher level of awareness of water conservation. <span class="citation" data-cites="gregoryRepeatedBehaviorEnvironmental2003">(Gregory and Leo 2003)</span> However, these study water quantity, not water quality, so they are not necessarily analogous.</p>
<h3 id="linking-the-two">Linking the Two</h3>
<p>While many studies have examined the issues discussed earlier, few have looked at the alignment of water quality perceptions and actual water quality. One such study was conducted in Newfoundland, Canada, which “investigated public perceptions of water quality and the perceived health risks and associated with the actual quality of public water supplies in the same communities.” <span class="citation" data-cites="ochooAssociationPerceptionsPublic2017">(Ochoo, Valcour, and Sarkar 2017)</span> While they found “no association with public satisfaction level and actual water quality of the respective communities,” they did show demographic disparities in water quality perception.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Furthermore, the authors found that differences in opinion existed between respondents who were supplied by the same water system. However, this is expected due to the problematic nature of public opinion. <span class="citation" data-cites="shepardPublicOpinion1909">(Shepard 1909)</span> The authors also mentioned that water quality data is publicly available, but is most likely not communicated in a way which facilitated knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>Another study investigated discrepancies in drinking water quality and behavior of household water treatment in Nepal. <span class="citation" data-cites="kunwarWaterQualityAvoidance2019">(Kunwar and Bohara 2019)</span> They found that perception and real drinking water quality influences behavior – a deviation between the two was determined to be a primary factor in using water treatment techniques, in addition to drinking water source, income, education, and taste.</p>
<p>An investigation into public perception, knowledge and behavior regarding river water quality was conducted in India <span class="citation" data-cites="tarannumUnderstandingPublicPerception2018">(Tarannum, Kansal, and Sharma 2018)</span> They found that respondents use mostly lived experience, and not scientific methods, to shape their perception of river water quality, while risk perception was directly linked to their utilization of the river in their daily lives.</p>
<h6 id="notes">Notes</h6>
<p>China’s political situation does not negate the impact that society can have on environmental policy. One study found that Chinese civil society organizations (CSOs) work in similar ways to those in more liberal and democratic countries. <span class="citation" data-cites="teetsPowerPolicyNetworks2018">(Teets 2018)</span></p>

<h1 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h1>
<p>This research proposal looked at many publications covering a broad range of related topics, some of which are outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="mekonnenFourBillionPeople2016">(Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2016)</span> analyzed the current situation of water scarcity worldwide and found “two-thirds of the global population (4.0 billion people) live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the year,” with nearly half living in China and India alone.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="liuWaterSustainabilityChina2012">(Liu and Yang 2012)</span> look at water sustainability in China. They conclude that while China’s recent policy efforts to alleviate water scarcity have been laudable, they are insufficient.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="araralWaterGovernanceReview2013">(Araral and Wang 2013)</span> look at water governance, water insecurity, and its related research. They find that a second-generation research agenda on water governance, including a focus on incentive structures and other multi-disciplinary approaches, is required.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="kahnWaterManagementCrop2009">(Kahn, Hanjra, and Mu 2009)</span> looks at the effects that water management has on crop production and food security in China. They conclude that water management affects many aspects of China’s development, it also affects food pricing and security globally.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="araralWaterGovernanceReview2013">(Araral and Wang 2013)</span> looks at the relationship between water resource management and droughts in China and find that demand-side management can be more effective in meeting the challenges imposed by increasingly-severe droughts.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="piaoImpactsClimateChange2010">(Piao et al. 2010)</span> looks at the impacts of climate change on water resources and agriculture in China. They recommend that further research should be conducted to further understand the impacts of climate change.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="baiSustainableUrbanWater2001">(Bai and Imura 2001)</span> look at sustainable urban water resource management with a case study analysis of Tianjin, China. They suggest that a holistic, systems approach to water management is key for sustainability.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="luWaterInfrastructureChina2014">(Lu 2014)</span> looks at the importance of full project life-cycle cost analysis in addressing water challenges, particularly with wastewater treatment facilities, concluding that there are serious inefficiencies currently.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="rogersPoliticsWaterReview2017">(Rogers and Crow-Miller 2017)</span> take more of an overview approach in synthesizing literature regarding the politics of water in China. They find that there are serious gaps in the literature regarding hydropolitics in China.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="webberSouthNorthWater2017">(Webber, Crow-Miller, and Rogers 2017)</span> look at the infrastructure side of water resource management in China with a review of the South-North Water Transfer Project. They find that this project is emblematic of the engineering-heavy approach often taken in China and will pose serious risks to regional governance and have serious environmental impacts.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="jinAirPollutionControl2016">(Jin, Andersson, and Zhang 2016)</span> looks at air pollution control policies in China with a retrospective perspective. They break down the history of air pollution policies into three phases, and conclude, amongst other takeaways, that there’s a continuously increasing demand for quantification of all aspects regarding air pollution, including air quality, source identification, atmospheric modeling, and health risk assessments. These conclusions have the potential to be analogous to future water policy.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="hofstedtChinaWaterScarcity2010">(Hofstedt 2010)</span> looks at the implications of domestic and international stability stemming from China’s water scarcity and the government’s current plans to address it. They argue that many of the options to alleviate water scarcity (increase water pricing, remove the requirement to be self-sufficient in grain production, increased efficiency of water usage in agriculture) all have serious downsides, and can have serious negative effects on political stability domestically and internationally.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="wardDatarichInformationpoorSyndrome1986">(Ward and Loftis 1986)</span> looks at water quality monitoring and improvements (at the time) in data collection. They argue that increased data collection itself is not enough to affect the management of water resources; data analysis and reporting are also very important, and that understanding why monitoring water quality is important in the design process of water quality monitoring itself.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="glasgowRealtimeRemoteMonitoring2004">(Glasgow et al. 2004)</span> looks at the emerging technology surrounding real-time remote monitoring (RTRM) and concludes that this technology will have a progressively-larger impact and importance for monitoring water quality.</li>
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="shirodeIOTBasedWater2018">(Shirode et al. 2018)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="abubakerStudyIOTApproach2018">(Abubaker et al. 2018)</span> look at the emerging technology of an Internet of Things (IoT) based water quality monitoring system. They show that this kind of system can address some of the limitations of manual, lab-based water quality testing (time-consuming, costly, etc.), and their real-time monitoring capabilities offer a large potential for improved water quality monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="research-questions">Research Questions</h1>
<p>Based on the literature review and background information, there is utility in examining relationships between water quality, knowledge, perception, and other variables. Several questions are examined:</p>
<ul>
<li>R1. Is there a relationship between water quality and perception of water quality? (I.e. do perceptions and reality match)?</li>
<li>R2. Does knowledge of water quality affect perception?</li>
<li>R3. Does the level of obtained education relate to water quality knowledge?</li>
<li>R4. Does the level of obtained education relate perception?</li>
<li>R5. Are there differences between water quality perception, and water quality knowledge, in rural vs. urban households?</li>
</ul>
<p>From these questions, several hypotheses emerge:</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The scope of this thesis is to provide a multi-variable descriptive analysis of the relations between water quality, education, perception, knowledge. Rural status is also examined in one research question, and is used as a control variable in others. Other demographic data and question responses are used to aid the analysis and discussion, but are assumed to be outside of the scope unless specifically mentioned. Further, multi-variable analysis which analyze these variables concurrently is also outside of the scope of this thesis.</p>

<p>The main analysis of this thesis center around two data sets, described below.</p>
<h3 id="chinese-general-social-survey-cgss">Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS)</h3>
<p>This national survey, originally launched in 2003, aims to monitor and document relationships between quality of life (in both individual and collective scope) and social structures, both in urban and rural environments. <span class="citation" data-cites="HomeZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha">(<span>“Home-中国综合社会调查”</span> n.d.)</span> One of the main benefits is its longitudinal design – however this feature is not utilized in this thesis, which will be discussed later. The survey has been conducted nearly annually since 2003, with a major redesign conducted in 2010. Thus, surveys conducted prior to 2010 are referred to as “Cycle II” while surveys conducted in 2010 or later are referred to as “Cycle II.”</p>
<p>The CGSS is conducted by face-to-face interviews, which on average require 90 minutes to complete. <span class="citation" data-cites="ImplementationZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha">(<span>“Implementation-中国综合社会调查”</span> n.d.)</span> The survey consists of a questionnaire, which is composed of three modules (beginning in Cycle II):</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="QuestionnairesZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha">(<span>“Questionnaires-中国综合社会调查”</span> n.d.)</span></p>
<p>The published data is in the form of a Stata file, which consists of 11783 rows (respondents) and 871 columns (variables).</p>
<p>The Environmental Module (“环境(ISSP)” or “L部分”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>) is of particular interest in this analysis. <span class="citation" data-cites="DiaoChaWenJuanZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha">(<span>“调查问卷-中国综合社会调查”</span> n.d.)</span> It asks 25 questions and sub-questions, most of which are directly or indirectly related to the environment. There are several interesting questions which ask things related to environmental protection, importance, perception and knowledge:</p>
<p>The primary question regarding water quality perception was question <code>l14d</code> ask about the severity of harm to the environment caused by pollution of rivers and lakes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Survey participants can respond with a range from one to five, with one being “extremely harmful to the environment,” to five being “there is no harm at all.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This question is significant because it quantifies the respondents’ perception of the severity of water quality on the environment. However, this question does not directly regard the perception of drinking water quality, or the importance of drinking water quality for health or other factors.</p>
<p>The primary question regarding water quality knowledge was question <code>l2409</code> tests respondents’ knowledge of the water quality scale used by China. The question requires respondents to state if a statement about water quality is correct, incorrect, or if they don’t know.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> This question is important since it tests respondents’ knowledge of the water quality scoring system used in China. However, this question does not directly test users knowledge of the underlying environmental and pollutant issues which are the basis of this water quality scale, nor does it test their knowledge or education about environmental issues or protection directly.</p>
<p>Many other interesting questions are present in the data set. For this thesis, several others were selected, and the values were analyzed. This discussion is presented later in this thesis.</p>
<h3 id="blue-city-water-quality-index-ranking-wqir">Blue City Water Quality Index Ranking (WQIR)</h3>
<p>The second data set was compiled by the author from a report from the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs, a non-profit environmental research organization based in Beijing. <span class="citation" data-cites="IPE">(<span>“About IPE”</span> n.d.)</span> The report, the <em>Blue City Water Quality Index 2019</em>, compiles various surface, drinking, and ground water quality data published by various government agencies and assigns a score (their proprietary <em>Blue City Water Quality Index Score (BCWQI)</em>) and publishes the results at a sub-provincial level (second administrative level, or “admin 2”). <span class="citation" data-cites="jun2018BlueCity">(Jun, Sunan, and Haijin, n.d.)</span> The methodology and conversion to the government’s water quality score is provided. This report was chosen as the basis for this data set since it was the most comprehensive data the author could find with the closest publication date to the CGSS. The difference in time of the two data sets is discussed in the section. In the appendix of this report, the BCWQI for each second administrative level, including the city name, province, and ranking, is included. This data, in a table in the PDF report, was exported into a comma separated value (.csv) file for later analysis.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the water quality score used in the WQIR data set is derived from the official Chinese water quality scoring system. The following table translates between the two scoring systems: <span class="citation" data-cites="jun2018BlueCity">(Jun, Sunan, and Haijin, n.d., 5)</span></p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Analysis for this thesis was conducted using the general-purpose computer programming language Python. To allow for accessibility, readability, and reproducibility, the primary data analysis medium was a Jupyter notebook <span class="citation" data-cites="kluyverJupyterNotebooksPublishing">(Kluyver et al., n.d.)</span>, a document format which allows for text and code to be read and execute in an easy-to-read format, which was hosted on GitHub, to allow for accessibility. <span class="citation" data-cites="rynearsonWrynearsonChinawater2020">(Rynearson 2020)</span> This was chosen after initial data analysis was conducted in a more traditional Python file, which was less collaborative and more cumbersome.</p>
<p>The two main data sets were loaded into the Jupyter notebook and reviewed for initial analysis, beginning with the CGSS2010. Then, after reviewing the data, it was cleaned and processed in several ways:</p>
<h3 id="choosing-appropriate-questions">Choosing Appropriate Questions</h3>

<p>The thesis proposal and hypothesis were created before the author reviewed the data set, and before the author was aware of the environmental module of the CGSS. While many variables were deemed interesting, several variables were initially selected for broader analysis:<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

Not all of the variables were utilized, such as income and subjective personal health, since they were outside of the scope of this thesis. 

#### Environmental Questions
The CGSS includes many demographic data on each respondent. Of which, the following were deemed important for one or more reasons: [^-4823810281]

<p>As evident, these questions include questions related to the environment in general, perceptions of the local, national and global environment, water, and knowledge of water quality issues.</p>
<p>Many more survey questions were included in the main and additional module sections. Many of these relate to social satisfaction, political involvement, and future aspirations. Future analysis could be done with many of these questions, but were not within the scope of this analysis.</p>

<h3 id="geographic-alignment">Geographic Alignment</h3>
<p>The two data sets are of differing geographic precision. The CGSS2010 (and all CGSSII data sets) include data on the province of where the respondent resided. Based on the structure of the data, it is assumed that more precise geographic information is included, however the CGSS publishing team chooses only to release the provincial information.</p>
<p>This is different than the WQIR2018 data, which is published at the sub-provincial level (admin 2). Thus, for comparative analysis, the mean water quality per province was calculated (more on this below).</p>
<p><strong>Insert Admin1 and Admin 2 maps here.</strong></p>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<p>Once the data sets were loaded and reviewed for importance and quality, initial data analysis was conducted. Due to the author’s limited experience with Python, multiple versions of the analysis were conducted in order to gain working knowledge of Python and of the data set.</p>
<p>For provincial comparative analysis, the data was sorted by province <code>s41</code> and grouped into visual and numerical approaches of looking for differences between provinces. Several functions were created which allowed the author, and users, to see provincial comparative analyses on any question by inputting the question code. Either quantities of responses or their mean value would be output, as well as a heatmap for quick comparison. This initial analysis helped the author validate the main variables that were analyzed, which are discussed later.</p>
<p>Then, the WQIR2018 data was loaded. An initial plot was created to see the distribution of water quality per sub-province, sorted by province. Histograms were added to visualize the distribution of water quality measurements and values.</p>
<p><code>{figure} ../wqir2018.svg :name: wqir2018-vis WQIR2018 distribution per province.</code> <img src="/home/will/Documents/Github/china-water/src/wqir2018.svg" alt="wqir2018.svg" /></p>
<p>From the previous steps, a subset of questions were created. Two main questions and one demographic variable were identified for further analysis: question <code>l14d</code> was used as the the main question to quantify perception<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>; <code>l2409</code> was used as the main question to quantify water quality knowledge<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>; and <code>a7a</code> was used to quantify education.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> These questions are discussed more in depth in the following limitations section. Other demographic data was used to control for results of the analysis. Many other relevant and interesting questions could be investigated from the data, but they are outside of the scope of this thesis.</p>
<p>Next, the values of these were examined. The author spent significant effort on this stage to better understand the state of the data set, and to understand the implications of choices in cleaning this data. Several revealed to be outside of the acceptable range, such as being recorded as negative numbers not present in the valid response list. Since the origin or reason behind these values could not be determined, they were discarded. This lead to further discrepancies in the number of values per category, including per province, education, perception and knowledge. This is discussed further in the analysis section.</p>
<p>Once invalid values were removed, the two data sets were merged on their shared province values. This was done in two separate ways, which allowed for different analysis.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>On Provinces</strong>: The mean water quality per province was added to the mean value per province of each analyzed variable. This allows for simpler data analysis, but loses some individual demographic data (gender, income, age, education, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>On Individuals</strong>: The mean water quality per province was added to the individual response values. This makes the analysis slightly more complicated, but allows for comparison across the demographic data mentioned above. However, it should be noted that it runs the risk of providing a false sense of improved precision, and the mean water quality of the province may not accurately reflect the local situation of the individual.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the author spent substantial time on analysis using the first method, the results of this study are mostly presented using the second method as they are more robust. The author conducted a large correlation test examining the correlation between every combination of questions and demographic data. While this test provided interesting results and provided inspiration for further investigation, most of the findings were outside of the scope of this thesis.</p>
<p>Once the data was analyzed, the author aligned the research questions and hypothesis with the data set variables. Each research question, and each tested hypothesis, was examined for correlations between two relevant variables, and were compared against one or more variables as a control. The analysis and findings are mentioned in the analysis section.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Several limitations exist based on the scope of both data sets, as well as limitation with some of the assumptions made by the author.</p>
<p>First, as discussed previously, there is misalignment between the CGSS and the WQIR data sets on two dimensions. The first is geographic. Since water quality data offered more geographic precision than the social survey responses (i.e. smaller regions), the effectiveness of comparison is reduced. This is in addition to the fact that water quality scores were originally presented as mean values per prefectural regions. This is different than the CGSS responses – while they were recorded at a more local level, geographic alignment information is only available at the provincial level. Further, the comparison between individuals and mean values per prefectural region results in the possibility that an two individuals in the same prefectural region experience different water quality, which is not possible to account for in the current methodology.</p>
<p>The second misaligned dimension is temporal, as the CGSS responses and water quality data differ by seven years. This is not ideal, since multiple indicators could have changed between that time. One is water quality, which has changed due to factors including the national government’s initiatives, but this change has not been uniform across the country. Another indicator which could have changed is knowledge about water quality issues. Third, perception of water quality could have changed as well.</p>
<p>Further limitations come from the perceived findings based upon the CGSS question set. The two main questions which were analyzed, <code>l14d</code> and <code>l2409</code>, are not perfectly analogous to the conclusions the author made. <code>l14d</code> refers more to rivers and lakes in China, which are not necessarily the drinking water sources which are used by the respondent. Further, the severity of pollution being harmful to the environment is not necessarily the same as the respondents’ perception. <code>l2409</code> directly tests respondents’ knowledge of water quality scales used by China, but this question, and <code>l14d</code>, do not necessarily test for knowledge, and perception, of the local water quality - the question refers to China in general.</p>
<p>— # Notes - Those who are more aware about environmental issues may be more knowledgeable about water issues (<code>l7a</code>). - Mention that water pollution is the 2nd highest category counted for <code>l7a</code> and 3rd for <code>l7b</code> - To ask perception in a different way, I could use respondents who say water is #1 from <code>l7a</code> <code>l7b</code> instead of <code>l14d</code>and if the trends matching education, perception and quality are the same. - Those who think <code>l14d</code> is harmful probably think that water pollution is #1 for <code>l7a</code> and <code>l7b</code></p>

<p>For the following hypotheses, it is important to remember the question types and response ranges. As the level of perceived harm increases for <code>l14d</code>, the value decreases. As responses approaches 2 for <code>l2409</code>, the knowledge about water quality issues is assumed to increase. While this is as set of binary responses, it is calculated as a mean later in this analysis.</p>

<p>There is a statistically significant (<span class="math inline">\(p=4.98 \text{e-}9\)</span>) correlation with a large number of responses (<span class="math inline">\(n = 3253\)</span>). Thus, actual water quality is related to perception of water quality, and worse water quality relates to an increase in perception of severity. However, there is a poor regression fit (coefficient of determination <span class="math inline">\(r=-0.1023\)</span>). Note that the range of water quality scores is large when respondents reply with the most-severe perception response type (<code>l14d</code>= 5).</p>

<p>There appears to be a relationship between water quality knowledge and perception from the smaller sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n=861\)</span>). Respondents who replied incorrectly (when <span class="math inline">\(\text{l2409}=1\)</span>) (<span class="math inline">\(n=282\)</span>) have a mean perception response <span class="math inline">\(\text{l14d}=2.383\)</span>, while respondents who replied correctly (when <span class="math inline">\(\text{l2409}=2\)</span>) (<span class="math inline">\(n=579\)</span>) have a mean perception response <span class="math inline">\(\text{l14d}=2.197\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is a statistically significant (<span class="math inline">\(p= 8.81 \text{e-}4\)</span>) correlation, however there is a poor regression fit (coefficient of determination <span class="math inline">\(r=-0.1023\)</span>).</p>
<p>With increased water quality knowledge (<span class="math inline">\(\text{l2409}=2\)</span>), environmental perception is increased (decreased <code>l14d</code>). However, this trend is no longer visible when factoring for rural/urban <code>a91</code>, education level <code>a7a</code>, and for other demographic question. For more conclusive results, further multi-variable statistical analysis is required.</p>

<p>There seems to be a relation between these two variables. Since <code>l2409</code> is analyzed as a binary variable (only two responses), values from each education level are averaged to find the mean.</p>

Further comparison with rural versus non-rural responses reveal large differences in both the typical level of education and the number of responses per rural classifier.</p>

<p>There is a clear trend between education and perception, with a larger sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n=3252\)</span>).

<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The analysis above produced interesting results. Overall, all five hypotheses were proven correct, with the limitation that all regression analyses provide a poor fit to model these trends. This can be explained that there are variable(s) which are contributing to this trend which are not accounted for in the simple two-variable regression analysis. Another interpretation could be that there factors influencing these correlations which are not accounted for in the data sets analyzed for this thesis. Further analysis is required to explain the causes of this poor fit. The limitations discussed previously, including geographic precision, differences in periods of time and applicability of the analyzed questions, should also be noted. Given more data, specifically updated CGSS results when the environmental module is included, would give the opportunity to conduct a longitudinal analysis.</p>
