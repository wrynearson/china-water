#  Methodology
The main analysis of this thesis center around two datasets.

## Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS)

This national survey, originally launched in 2003, aims to monitor and document relationships between quality of life (in both individual and collective scope) and social structures, both in urban and rural environments. [@HomeZhongGuoZongHeSheHuiDiaoCha] One of the main benefits is its longitudinal design, however this feature is not utilized in this thesis, which will be discussed later. The survey has been conducted nearly annually since 2003, with a major redesign conducted in 2010. Thus, surveys conducted prior to 2010 are referred to as "Cycle II" while surveys conducted in 2010 or later are referred to as "Cycle II."

The CGSS is conducted by face-to-face interviews, which on average require 90 minutes to complete. **CITE @Implementation** The survey consists of a questionnaire, which is composed of three modules (beginning in Cycle II):

| *Module*              | Frequency                | Dimensions | Variables | Coverage         | Comments                                                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core                  | Annual                   | 11         | 152       | All participants |                                                              |
| ^Background Variables | Annual                   |            | 71        | All participants |                                                              |
| ^Social Change Trends | Annual                   |            | 81        | All participants |                                                              |
| Topic                 | Annual (5 year rotation) |            |           | All participants | *Either one or two topic modules per year.*                  |
| Additional            |                          |            |           | 1/3 - 1/2        | *Coverage depends on quantity of other questions and demand* |[@Questionnaires]

The Environmental Module ("环境(ISSP)" or "L部分") is of particular interest in this analysis. [@diaocha] It asks 25 questions and subquestions, most of which are directly or indirectly related to the environment. There are several interesting questions which ask things related to environmental protection, importance, perception and knowledge.

**Talk about specific questions, etc.**

The published data is in the form of a Stata file, which consists of 11783 rows (respondents) and 871 columns (variables).
