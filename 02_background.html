<p>In this section, background knowledge and literature review relevant to this thesis is provided. First, literature of global and Chinese water resource trends and implications are presented. Then, the case is made for holistic water resource management in China. Later, research into education, knowledge and perception of the environment broadly and water quality is presented. Finally, the lack of research linking these themes together, and the utility of this thesis, is justified.</p>

<h2>Water Resource Management — Trends and Implications<a class="headerlink" href="#water-resource-management-trends-and-implications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Water scarcity is a worldwide phenomenon with particular importance to China. <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id94" title="Mesfin M. Mekonnen and Arjen Y. Hoekstra. Four billion people facing severe water scarcity. Science Advances, 2016.">Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016</a>]</span> analyzed the current situation of water scarcity worldwide and found “two-thirds of the global population (4.0 billion people) live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the year,” with nearly half living in China and India alone.</p>
<p>Despite the governments past and current efforts, further action is required. <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id104" title="Jianguo Liu and Wu Yang. Water Sustainability for China and Beyond. Science, 337:649–650, 2012.">Liu and Yang, 2012</a>]</span> look at water sustainability in China. They conclude that while China’s recent policy efforts to alleviate water scarcity have been laudable, they are insufficient. They are also inefficient, especially with regards to engineering and infrastructural approaches. <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id99" title="Shuping Lu. Water infrastructure in China: the importance of full project life-cycle cost analysis in addressing water challenges. International Journal of Water Resources Development, 30(1):47–59, 2014.">Lu, 2014</a>]</span> looks at the importance of full project life-cycle cost analysis in addressing water challenges, particularly with wastewater treatment facilities, concluding that there are serious inefficiencies currently. <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id88" title="Michael Webber, Britt Crow-Miller, and Sarah Rogers. The South–North Water Transfer Project: remaking the geography of China. Regional Studies, 51(3):370–382, 2017.">Webber <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>]</span> look at the infrastructure side of water resource management in China with a review of the South-North Water Transfer Project and find that this project is emblematic of the engineering-heavy approach often taken in China and will pose serious risks to regional governance and have serious environmental impacts. This may be due to the increased likelihood of large, transformative projects, and their political champions, receiving more political praise than with incremental efficiency improvements — one study found that for public private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects, personal political promotion was the primary factor for promoting these projects. <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id118" title="Ling Wang, Lihong Zhou, Yan Xiong, and Dongyi Yan.

They find that a second-generation research agenda on water governance, including a focus on incentive structures and other multi-disciplinary approaches, is required. Not all management should be on the supply side, at least in regards to aleviating water scarcity. <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id95" title="Xiao-jun Wang, Jian-un Zhang, Shamsuddin Shahid, Amgad ElMahdi, Rui-min He, Zhen-xin Bao, and Mahtab Ali.

Multiple approaches should be taken in unison. <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id106" title="Todd Hofstedt. China's Water Scarcity and Its Implications for Domestic and International Stability. Asian Affairs: An American Review, 37:71–83, 2010.">Hofstedt, 2010</a>]</span> looks at the implications of domestic and international stability stemming from China’s water scarcity and the government’s current plans to address it. They argue that many of the options to alleviate water scarcity (increase water pricing, remove the requirement to be self-sufficient in grain production, increased efficiency of water usage in agriculture) all have serious downsides, and can have serious negative effects on political
stability domestically and internationally.</p>

data collection. They argue that increased data collection itself is not enough to affect the management of water resources; data analysis and reporting are also very important, and that understanding why monitoring water quality is important in the design process of water quality monitoring itself.</p>

<p>Thus, this definition of environmental perception is applied to water quality perception: <em>water quality perception</em> is the recognition of water quality as a problem.

This definition is elaborated upon with the data used for this analysis in the methodology section.</p>

<h3>Environmental Aspects in China<a class="headerlink" href="#environmental-aspects-in-china" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Despite its international perception of poor environmental protection, China does have history of concern with environmental degradation. In terms of history, the consensus in China amongst researchers is that the field of environmental history originated in the United States in the early 1970s and came to China in the 1990s. <span id="id22">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id28" title="Zhaoqing Han.

<p>There is also evidence showing that environmental issues and their repercussions are deemed important by the local population. One study found that Chinese university students were more concerned about environmental risk and deemed “environmental issues to be more harmful to health, to the environment, and to social economic development of the nation than did the American respondents.” <span id="id25">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id67" title="Hongxia Duan and Rosanne Fortner.

<p>Finally, simple analysis of China’s one-party political implementation might lead one to assume that civil society has little to no influence on environmental policy. However, this does not appear to be the case. One study found that Chinese civil society organizations (CSOs) work in similar ways to those in more liberal and democratic countries. <span id="id26">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id59" title="Jessica Teets.

<h3>Environmental Knowledge and Education<a class="headerlink" href="#environmental-knowledge-and-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Knowledge about most topics is learned through theory (education) and practice (experience). This is no different with the environment. The term <em>Environmental Knowledge</em> (EK) accounts for multiple ways of learning and acquisition. In the 1970s, authors stressed the complicated pathways from information to knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“…the acquisition of environmental knowledge involves a complicated series of processes – sensation, perception, imagery, retention, recall, reasoning, problem solving, judgment, and evaluation. It is an individual process, each person having a unique cognition of the world, but the overlap in images among individuals permits environmental communication.” <span id="id27">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id40" title="Briavel Holcomb.

</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Environmental Education</em> (EE) is a subset of Environmental Knowledge and is inexorably tied to environmental protection and policy One of its main goals is “Awareness - to help social groups and individuals acquire an awareness and sensitivity to the total environment and its allied problems.” <span id="id28">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id66" title="Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education, Tbilisi, USSR, 14-26 October 1977: final report - UNESCO Digital Library.

<blockquote>
<div><p>Environmental education is aimed at producing a citizenry that is knowledgeable concerning the biophysical environment and its associated problems, aware of how to help solve these problems, and motivated to work towards their solution. <span id="id29">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id65" title="William B Stapp, Dean Bennett, William Bryan, Jerome Fulton, Jean MacGregor, Paul Nowak, James Swan, and Robert Wall.

URL: http://www.hiddencorner.us/html/PDFs/The_Concept_of_EE.pdf.">Stapp <em>et al.</em>, 1969</a>]</span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>While there is a longer document environmental protection movement in the United States than in China, it is important to note that Dr. Stapp wrote this definition with the perspective that only 50 years had passed since much of the United States was rural and underdeveloped. It can be argued that China shares this temporal perspective today.</p>
<p>Progress continued with development and deployment of EE the international level, with many landmark events in environmentalism and sustainability putting EE at their core, including The International Environmental Education Program (IEEP 1975), the World Conservation Strategy (IUCN 1980), ‘Tbilisi Plus Ten’ (1987), Our Common Future (WCED 1987), and The Earth Summit (UNCED). <span id="id30">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id64" title="Philip Neal and Joy Palmer.

<p>EE also has the potential for direct and indirect positive environmental impacts. One study reviewed 105 EE studies which emphasized conservation outcomes, and found that EE programs which included and focused on ecological indicators (such as improved water quality) had outcomes with the most directness (as opposed to indirect impact categories such as community capacity building), and concluded that local aspects of regional and global problems are important for the directness of the link. <span id="id31">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id63" title="Nicole M.

<p>Several other studies have mixed results.

<h3>Environmental Perception<a class="headerlink" href="#environmental-perception" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is an intuitive link between the state of the environment and one’s perception of the environment. Environmental perception has been defined as “awareness of, or feelings about, the environment, and as the act of apprehending the environment by the senses.” <span id="id34">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id42" title="Ervin H. Zube. Environmental perception. In Environmental Geology, pages 214–216. Springer Netherlands, Dordrecht, 1999.

Ittelson. Environment and cognition. Environment and cognition. Seminar Press, Oxford, England, 1973. ISBN 978-0-12-853550-9. Pages: xii, 187.">Ittelson, 1973</a>]</span> He offered three general conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="simple">
<li><p>It is not directly controlled by the stimulus.</p></li>
<li><p>It is linked to and indistinguishable from other aspects of psychological functioning.</p></li>
<li><p>It is relevant and appropriate to specific environmental contexts.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These conclusions are rather vague in this form. Ittelson continues in his theoretical framework and suggest that environments “surround the person, provide opportunities for exploration, and provide information that is received through all senses – feeling, hearing, seeing, smelling, and tasting.” <span id="id36">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id42" title="Ervin H. Zube. Environmental perception. In Environmental Geology, pages 214–216. Springer Netherlands, Dordrecht, 1999.

Additionally, according to Ittleson, environments have ambiance – a “quality, mood or atmosphere” which can relate to the social context of environmental experience, and is viewed through the lens of past experience and current perceptions. Simply put, environments affect both individuals and societal groups in ways which are not always easy to understand, and can change or be affected in the present and the past. This has an affect on policy, as information regarding how the general population feels about the environment can inform policy makers.</p>
<p>While studies into societies’ perception of the environment often focuses on positive aspects when investigating wilderness and landscape aesthetics, studies regarding air, water and sound usually focus on negative factors. <span id="id37">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id42" title="Ervin H.

Interestingly, different cultures have been found to have different threshold qualitative pollution or annoyance levels, which could be seen as a limitation of this study.</p>
<p>One other factor in environmental perception was the “magnitude, diversity and rapidity of environmental change.” <span id="id38">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id42" title="Ervin H.

These are broken down into several categories, including microbial aspects, chemical aspects, radiological aspects, and acceptability aspects. For this thesis, the exact determinate of these components are not investigated, nor are the relative importance between certain indicators and perception, or knowledge. However, it should be noted that not all indicators of water quality have direct negative health implications – for the acceptability aspects (also referred to as aesthetic aspects), undesirable qualities (including taste, smell, and color) can erode public trust in otherwise healthy drinking water. <span id="id43">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id12" title="missing author in worldhealthorganizationGuidelinesDrinkingwaterQuality2017">World Health Organization, 2017</a>]</span></p>

<h3>Water Quality Perception<a class="headerlink" href="#water-quality-perception" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While actual water quality is clearly important, so too is perception. Many factors exist in the public’s perception of water quality. While “organoleptic properties” exist, most notably flavor, others exist including “risk perception, attitudes towards water chemicals, contextual cues provided by the supply system, familiarity with specific water properties, trust in suppliers, past problems attributed to water quality and information provided by the mass media and interpersonal sources.” <span id="id66">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id51" title="Miguel de França Doria.

Trends indicate that water quality policy should include not only the protection of human health, but also “acceptability.” <span id="id68">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id56" title="The Bonn Charter for Safe Drinking Water. 2004.

<p>Research into water quality perception has existed since the 1960s, but is very heterogeneous, including; different use cases of water (drinking, household, agricultural, etc.); different delivery methods (piped, bottled) and different geographic and demographic localities, with most research conducted on bottled water and in developed countries. <span id="id69">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id51" title="Miguel de França Doria.

<p>One study represented research in an under-studied theme and demographic. Stakeholders’ perceptions of important measures of river water quality in one region of Ghana suggest that in developing countries (or regions with lower objective water quality), faecal matter in and around rivers, and presence of plastic waste in rivers was deemed to be the most important measure, followed by the smell, clarity, color, and taste (“organoleptic properties”) of the water. <span id="id70">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id52" title="Murat Okumah, Ata Senior Yeboah, and Sylvester Kwaku Bonyah.

<p>Multiple factors drive perception of environmental issues. In a related issue, water scarcity, one study examined farmers’ (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n = 446\)</span>) awareness and perception of water shortages in irrigation. <span id="id71">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id61" title="Jianjun Tang, Henk Folmer, and Jianhong Xue.

<h2>Linking Water Quality, Knowledge and Perception<a class="headerlink" href="#linking-water-quality-knowledge-and-perception" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While many studies have examined the issues discussed earlier, few have looked at the alignment of water quality perceptions and actual water quality. One such study was conducted in Newfoundland, Canada, which “investigated public perceptions of water quality and the perceived health risks and associated with the actual quality of public water supplies in the same communities.” <span id="id73">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id58" title="Benjamin Ochoo, James Valcour, and Atanu Sarkar.

However, this is expected due to the problematic nature of public opinion. <span id="id75">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id45" title="Walter J. Shepard. Public Opinion.

<p>Another study investigated discrepancies in drinking water quality and behavior of household water treatment in Nepal. <span id="id76">[<a class="reference internal" href="07_bibliography.html#id23" title="Samrat B.

<h2>Background Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#background-conclusions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In conclusion of the background terms, ideas and research, direct measurement of environmental quality is not the only variable in analyzing how the local population knows, perceives and interacts with their local and regional environment. As indicated, complicated education and knowledge pathways influence perception of water quality in addition to the standard hypothesis that direct water quality leads to perception. In order to mitigate the negative implications of water stress and poor water quality, further analysis of how these terms interact is vital.</p>

<dd><p>The authors concluded that “Older, higher educated and high-income group respondents were more satisfied with water quality than the younger, less educated and low-income group respondents.” However, they also stated that “We had little scope to explore the possible explanations, and hence further studies are required to verify the age, gender educational status and income differential about the satisfaction of public service like water supply.”</p>
