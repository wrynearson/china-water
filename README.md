For explanations and the code, open the `Thesis.ipynb` file in the `src` folder. This is the most up to date, but it's not complete. Feel free to run functions or add extra lines of code if you'd like.

The following data is in the `data` folder, most of which is fed into the `Thesis.ipynb` file.

- cgss2010_12.dta - The Stata file of the 2010 survey (most recent environmental data)
- wqir2018.csv - water quality score by sub province (admin2) in Chinese and English.
- s41.csv - linking provinces (Chinese) with their province code from the Stata file. This is copied into the Jupyter notebook, so you don't need it.
- combined.xlsx - linking population data with water quality. It's mostly done, but not complete since they don't align perfectly.
