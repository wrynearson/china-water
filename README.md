#  Thesis
##  Water Quality, Perception and Knowledge in China

For the thesis, open the `thesis-text.md` file in the `src` folder. As of now (Jan 31 2021), the following file is much more descriptive.

For explanations and the code, open the `thesis_analysis.ipynb` file in the `src` folder. This is the most up to date, but it's not complete. Feel free to run functions or add extra lines of code if you'd like.

The following data is in the `data` folder, most of which is fed into the `Thesis.ipynb` file.

- cgss2010_12.dta - The Stata file of the 2010 survey (most recent environmental data).
- wqir2018.csv - water quality score by sub province (admin2) in Chinese and English.
- prov.csv - linking provinces (Chinese) with their province code from the Stata file.
- combined.xlsx - linking population data with water quality. It's mostly done, but not complete since they don't align perfectly. *Will probably delete and instead link in population data.*
